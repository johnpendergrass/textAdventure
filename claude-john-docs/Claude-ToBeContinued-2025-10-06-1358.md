# Polish Session: Hints, Spacing, and Quality of Life Improvements

## Current State of Project

This afternoon session focused on final polish: improving hint formatting throughout the game, fixing spacing inconsistencies, adding bold formatting to directional commands, and implementing a fun hidden THROW command Easter egg. The game now has consistent, professional presentation throughout.

## Major Accomplishments Completed (October 6, 2025 - Afternoon Session)

### ✅ Hint Formatting Standardization

**Problem solved:** Hints were inconsistently formatted with improper spacing and capitalization.

**Changes implemented:**

1. **Lowercase "hint"** - Changed from "Hint:" to "hint:" throughout
   - More casual, less formal tone
   - Matches friendly game style

2. **Blank lines before hints** - Added `<br><br>` before all hint spans
   - Separates hints from flavor text for better readability
   - Applied to: welcome message, STREET-01, NICE-PORCH, FRONT-PORCH, FOYER

3. **Updated hint text** for clarity:
   - Welcome: `[hint: Type help or h for a list of commands (which are also shown in the bottom-right of the screen!)]`
   - STREET-01: `[hint: type go north (or just n) to go to the house, east (or e) to keep walking.]`
   - NICE-PORCH: `[hint: type ring doorbell or use doorbell to ring the doorbell.]`
   - FRONT-PORCH: `[hint: type use gong or use handle to sound the gong!.]`
   - FOYER: `[hint: type take <item> or get <item> to pick up items you find.]`

**Files modified:**
- textAdventure.js - Line 216
- gameData.json - Line 17
- rooms-w-doors.json - Lines 17, 50, 84, 100

### ✅ Bold Formatting for Directional Commands

**Problem solved:** Exit directions weren't visually consistent with other bolded commands in the game.

**Implementation:**
- Wrapped all directional words in exits with `<b>` tags
- Interior rooms: `Exits: <b>SOUTH</b> door, <b>NORTH</b> door`
- Exterior rooms: `Exits: <b>north</b>, <b>south</b>, <b>east</b>`

**Files modified:**
- textAdventure.js - Lines 711, 714 (displayRoom), 1844, 1847 (lookAtRoom)

**Visual result:**
```
Exits: north, south    →    Exits: north, south
```

### ✅ Command Echo Spacing Fix

**Problem solved:** Inconsistent blank lines between command and response.

**Root cause:** Movement commands added their own blank line, item commands didn't.

**Solution:**
1. `echoCommand()` adds ONE blank line after every command (line 1973)
2. Removed duplicate blank line from `movePlayer()` (removed line 769-771)

**Result:** All commands now have consistent spacing:
```
> command

Response text...
```

**Files modified:**
- textAdventure.js - Lines 1969-1974, 766-769

### ✅ Room Display Spacing Fix

**Problem solved:** Double blank lines between room description and exits when room had no items.

**Root cause:** Two separate blank lines were added (before items section, before exits).

**Solution:** Only add blank line when there's actual content to display
- Moved blank line INTO the "picked clean" message block
- Moved blank line INTO the "You see:" items block
- Single blank line before exits always remains

**Files modified:**
- textAdventure.js - Lines 664-688 (displayRoom), 1797-1821 (lookAtRoom)

**Visual improvement:**
```
BEFORE:
You are on the street.


Exits: north

AFTER:
You are on the street.

Exits: north
```

### ✅ Hidden THROW Command (Easter Egg)

**Problem solved:** Players might try to throw items, adding command makes game feel more complete.

**Implementation:**

1. **New command** in commands.json:
   - Command: "throw"
   - Shortcuts: "toss", "chuck", "hurl"
   - Action: "throw_item"
   - NOT shown in status panel (hidden Easter egg)

2. **handleThrowCommand()** function (lines 1037-1080):
   - Validates item in inventory
   - Returns random humorous rejection message
   - 5 different messages for variety:
     - "You consider throwing it, but decide that's a terrible idea."
     - "That seems like a waste. Better keep it."
     - "Nah, you might need that later."
     - "Why would you throw that? Think again."
     - "You raise your arm to throw, then think better of it."

3. **Error messages** work properly:
   - No item: "Throw what?"
   - Not in inventory: "You're not carrying any 'X'."

**Files modified:**
- commands.json - Lines 93-98
- textAdventure.js - Lines 1037-1080 (function), 2270-2272 (case statement)

**User experience:**
```
> throw
Throw what?

> throw apple
You consider throwing it, but decide that's a terrible idea.

> throw rock
You're not carrying any "rock".
```

### ✅ Item Updates (User Edits)

**Notable changes made by user:**
- Apple: Added "goldenapple", "goldendelicious" to typedNames
- Beatles: Changed from "White Album Vinyl" to "Revolver Music CD"
- Various scavenger item description refinements
- STREET-02: Added blank line before direction hint
- NICE-PORCH: Added additional hint about bolded words being interactive

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Hint Formatting Pattern
All hints now follow this pattern:
```
Flavor text describing the situation.<br><br><span style='color: #ffcc00;'>[hint: helpful text here.]</span>
```
- Two `<br>` tags create blank line
- Yellow color (#ffcc00) for visibility
- Lowercase "hint:" for casual tone
- Bold tags on commands/keywords

### Spacing Architecture Summary

**Command Echo (echoCommand):**
- Blank before command (separation from previous output)
- Blank after command (separation before response)

**Room Display (displayRoom/lookAtRoom):**
- Room description (no blank before)
- Blank + items/picked clean (only if content exists)
- Blank + exits (always)

**Movement (movePlayer):**
- No longer adds its own blank line
- Relies on echoCommand's blank line

### Random Message Selection
```javascript
const messages = [...];
const random = messages[Math.floor(Math.random() * messages.length)];
```
Simple random selection provides variety without complex logic.

## Immediate ToDo Items
