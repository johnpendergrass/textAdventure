# Claude-ToBeContinued - 2025-10-09-1830

## Current State - v0.36

**The Radley House** Halloween text adventure game has been updated with improved puzzle logic, new scavenger items, and better UX.

### Recent Session Work (Oct 9, 2025 - Evening)

#### Major Changes:

1. **NICE-PORCH Light Behavior Fix**
   - Fixed bug where porch light would turn off on second visit regardless of doorbell use
   - Now properly checks porch light state (visible=true/false) instead of visit count
   - Light stays on until doorbell is actually rung
   - Updated enterText messages to be less presumptive ("The porch is dark..." instead of "but you try the bell anyway")

2. **Scavenger Item Pickup Flow Improvement**
   - Changed from showing full examine text to showing brief description on pickup
   - Flow now: Take response → Image + badge → **Description** → Auto-LOOK
   - Examine text (with legal disclaimers, etc.) only shows when player explicitly examines item
   - Applied to all 9 scavenger items

3. **Safe Combination Change**
   - Changed from 13-97-55 to **6-6-6** ("number of the beast")
   - Updated bookmark clue text to show "number of the beast" instead of actual numbers
   - Makes puzzle more thematic for Halloween

4. **Krugerrand → Indian Head Pennies Replacement**
   - Replaced gold Krugerrand with two Indian Head pennies (c1909)
   - Updated Mrs. McGillicutty's list clue #3: "Atomic 79" → **"Old sense"** (sounds like "old cents")
   - New images: indianHeadPennies90x90.png, indianHeadPennies250x250.png
   - Description: "Two Indian Head pennies c1909"
   - Examine: "Two Indian Head United States pennies, c1909. Decent condition. I wonder why they were in the safe? Only worth $100 or so? Sentimental value I guess."
   - Take response: "You carefully put the two pennies in your pocket."

5. **Safe Puzzle Logic Enhancement**
   - Added requirement that player must have bookmark in inventory
   - Added requirement that player must have examined bookmark
   - Error messages:
     - Without bookmark: "You don't know the combination. You'll need to find a clue somewhere."
     - With bookmark but not examined: "The safe will not open until you find the clue about the combination."
   - Prevents players from guessing combination without finding the clue

6. **Bookmark Examination Tracking**
   - Added `hasBeenExamined` flag to bookmark (oldnote) item
   - Flag set to true when player examines bookmark
   - Required for safe opening logic
   - Works in both code paths (items with/without take actions)

### Current Game Statistics

- **Rooms**: 13 (START, STREET-01, STREET-02, NICE-PORCH, FRONT-PORCH, FOYER, LIBRARY, DINING-ROOM, STUDY, MUSIC-ROOM, GAME-ROOM, KITCHEN, BEDROOM, TV-ROOM, HOME)
- **Scavenger Items**: 9 (NVidia 5090, Monster Mash CD, Cat Mug, Cup O'Noodles, Stranger Things DVD, Odd Dog, **Indian Head Pennies**, Pumpkin, Frankenstein Book)
- **Candy/Treats**: 18 items
- **Commands**: 17 total
- **Doors**: 13 connections
- **Safe Combination**: 6-6-6 (clue: "number of the beast")

### Technical State

**Files Modified:**
- `textAdventure.js` - NICE-PORCH logic, scavenger pickup, safe logic, bookmark tracking
- `HALLOWEEN-GAME/rooms-w-doors.json` - NICE-PORCH enterText
- `HALLOWEEN-GAME/items.json` - Mrs. McGillicutty's list clue, bookmark hasBeenExamined flag
- `HALLOWEEN-GAME/scavengerItems.json` - replaced krugerrand with indianheadpennies

**Debug Console Logging:**
- Added debug logs for bookmark examination tracking
- Added debug logs for safe opening validation
- Should be removed before final release

### Immediate ToDo Items

1. **Validate Indian Head Pennies** ✋ NEXT
   - Test full puzzle flow: Find Frankenstein book → Examine book (reveals bookmark) → Examine bookmark (see "number of the beast") → Open safe with 6-6-6 → Get pennies
   - Verify pennies appear in scavenger grid
   - Verify pennies show correct description/examine text
   - Verify pennies work with DEBUG command
   - Test celebration triggers when all 9 items collected

2. **Swap Additional Scavenger Items** ✋ NEXT
   - Determine which other scavenger items to replace
   - Consider theme/difficulty/interest
   - Create new images if needed
   - Update clues in Mrs. McGillicutty's list

3. **Remove Debug Console Logs**
   - Remove temporary debug logging added for bookmark/safe testing
   - Lines to remove: bookmark examination logs, safe opening validation logs

4. **Scoring System**
   - TODO: Improve scoring calculation
   - Weight scavenger items vs treats
   - Calculate final score out of 100 points
   - Currently basic point accumulation

5. **Introduction Polish**
   - TODO: Review and polish START and STREET-01 text

### Long-term ToDo Items

1. **Sound Effects** - Add atmospheric sounds for:
   - Door gong
   - Door opening/closing
   - Item pickup
   - Celebration

2. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Current design is fixed 950x720

3. **Save/Load Game** - Allow players to save progress

4. **Additional Easter Eggs** - More hidden interactions

### Known Issues

- Debug console logging still present (intentional for testing, remove before release)
- Pennies need full validation testing

### Git Status

## Notes for Next Session

**Puzzle Flow for Safe:**
1. Player finds Frankenstein book in LIBRARY
2. Examining book reveals bookmark (auto-added to inventory)
3. Player examines bookmark → sees "number of the beast"
4. Player must recognize 666 = "number of the beast"
5. Player goes to STUDY, types SAY 6-6-6
6. Safe opens, reveals Indian Head pennies + parchment

**Item Replacement Considerations:**
- Keep variety in locations (don't cluster too many in same room)
- Maintain mix of difficulty (visible, hidden, puzzle-locked)
- Ensure clues are clever but solvable
- Consider thematic appropriateness for Halloween

**Code Quality:**
- Safe puzzle logic is now properly gated
- Scavenger pickup flow is cleaner
- Room state tracking is more reliable
