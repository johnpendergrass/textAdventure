# Halloween Text Adventure - Drop Command & Multi-Component Scoring System

## Current State of Project

Today's session has been **extremely productive** - we've implemented the drop command to complement the take system, streamlined item properties, and completely revamped the scoring system to track multiple components (Treats, Scavenger Hunt, Health). The game now has a comprehensive item interaction system and meaningful score tracking.

## Major Accomplishments Completed (September 29, 2025 - Afternoon Session)

### âœ… Drop Command Implementation
**Complete reverse of take command:**
- Added "drop" command with shortcuts: put, place
- Full validation: item must be in INVENTORY and have actions.take
- Moves items from INVENTORY back to current room
- Updates status panel in real-time
- Symmetric with take command logic

**Files modified:**
- commands.json - added drop command entry
- textAdventure.js - handleDropCommand() function, processCommand() case, showHelp() update
- CONFIG_FALLBACKS - added drop command fallback

### âœ… Commands Status Box Update
**Fixed missing commands in status panel:**
- Added take, examine, drop to commands list
- Updated both uiConfig.json and CONFIG_FALLBACKS
- Status box now shows: "(t)ake e(x)amine (d)rop"

### âœ… Inventory Display Enhancement
**Points display added to inventory:**
- Status panel shows: "Item name (+X)"
- Text command shows: "Item name (+X)"
- Clean, concise format instead of verbose "X points"

### âœ… Property Cleanup (items.json & scavengerItems.json)
**Removed unused properties:**
1. **capacity â†’ quantity** - Renamed, then completely removed (not used in code)
2. **itemType** - Removed from both files (never referenced)
3. **found** - Removed from items.json, kept in scavengerItems.json for hunt tracking

**Result:** Cleaner JSON with only active properties

### âœ… Health and Eatable Properties Added
**New item tracking fields:**
- **health: 1** for takeable items (have actions.take)
- **health: 0** for fixed items (no actions.take)
- **eatable: true** for takeable items
- **eatable: false** for fixed items

**Applied to:**
- items.json: 7 items (3 takeable, 4 fixed)
- scavengerItems.json: 10 items (all takeable)

**Purpose:** Foundation for eating mechanics and health tracking

### âœ… Multi-Component Scoring System (MAJOR FEATURE)
**Revolutionary score tracking:**

**1. Item Flagging System:**
- Scavenger items marked with `isScavengerItem: true` during merge
- Enables separate tracking of regular vs scavenger items

**2. Score Components:**
- **Treats Score** - Points from regular items only (candy, bag)
- **Scavenger Score** - Points from scavenger hunt items only
- **Health Score** - Player's current health value (starts at 100)
- **Total Score** - Sum of all three components

**3. Status Panel Renamed:**
- Changed from "STATUS:" to "SCORE:"
- Shows complete breakdown:
  ```
  SCORE:
  Treats: X
  Scavenger: Y
  Health: 100
  â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€
  Score: Total
  ```

**4. Player Score Updates:**
- `player.core.score` now tracks total score
- Updates automatically when items picked up/dropped
- Available for save/load functionality

### âœ… CONFIG_FALLBACKS.player Fix
**Critical structure update:**
- Old structure used `stats` object
- New structure uses `core` object with health: 100
- Matches runtimePlayerData structure from gameData.json
- Ensures health defaults to 100 when player.json missing

## Current File Architecture (ENHANCED)

### Core Game Files
- **textAdventure.html** - 1280Ã—720 three-panel layout
- **textAdventure.css** - Halloween-themed styling
- **textAdventure.js** - Enhanced engine (~1150 lines with scoring system)

### Game Data Files
- **rooms-w-doors.json** - 16 rooms (15 physical + INVENTORY)
- **commands.json** - 10 commands (added drop)
- **items.json** - 7 items with streamlined properties
- **scavengerItems.json** - 10 items with hunt tracking
- **gameData.json** - Game configuration and defaults
- **uiConfig.json** - UI panel configurations
- **keyboardShortcuts.json** - Keyboard controls

### Current Item Structure (Streamlined)
```json
"snickers_bar": {
  "includeInGame": true,
  "typedName": "snickers",
  "display": "Snickers mini-bar",
  "description": "A fun-size Snickers bar",
  "location": "FOYER",
  "points": 1,
  "health": 1,
  "eatable": true,
  "visible": true,
  "locked": false,
  "actions": {
    "examine": "It's a Snickers bar, what's not to like?",
    "take": {
      "response": "You pick up the Snickers bar.",
      "addToInventory": true
    },
    "eat": {
      "response": "Delicious! You feel slightly healthier.",
      "addHealth": 5,
      "removeItem": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Technical Architecture Enhancements

### Scoring System Flow
```
Item Pickup/Drop
    â†“
updateGameStatus() called
    â†“
Calculate Score Components:
  - Filter inventory items by isScavengerItem flag
  - Sum regular items â†’ Treats Score
  - Sum scavenger items â†’ Scavenger Score
  - Read player.core.health â†’ Health Score
    â†“
Total = Treats + Scavenger + Health
    â†“
Update player.core.score = Total
    â†“
Display breakdown in SCORE panel
```

### Item Flagging During Load
```javascript
// Load scavenger items
const scavengerItems = scavengerData.scavengerItems || {};

// Mark each scavenger item
Object.values(scavengerItems).forEach(item => {
  item.isScavengerItem = true;
});

// Merge into main items
items = { ...items, ...scavengerItems };
```

### Score Component Calculation
```javascript
let regularItemsScore = 0;
let scavengerScore = 0;

inventory.forEach(item => {
  const points = item.points || 0;
  if (item.isScavengerItem) {
    scavengerScore += points;
  } else {
    regularItemsScore += points;
  }
});

const healthScore = player?.core?.health || 0;
const totalScore = regularItemsScore + scavengerScore + healthScore;
```

## Current Game Experience

### âœ… Complete Command Set (10 commands)
**Movement:** north (n), south (s), east (e), west (w)
**Information:** help (h), look (l), inventory (i)
**Interaction:** take (get, grab, pick), examine (x, ex), drop (put, place)

### âœ… Interactive Gameplay Loop
1. **Navigate** through 15 rooms
2. **Discover** visible items in rooms
3. **Take** items with validation
4. **Examine** items (portable in inventory, fixed in place)
5. **Drop** items in any room
6. **Track Score** with detailed breakdown
   - Regular treats for points
   - Scavenger hunt progress
   - Health as score component

### âœ… Example Gameplay Session
```
> north
You enter the Radley House foyer.
Exits: south, north, east, west
You see:
  Snickers mini-bar
  Scavenger item #9

> get snickers
You pick up the Snickers bar.

> inventory
You are carrying:
  Snickers mini-bar (+1)

[Status panel updates:]

## NEXT PRIORITY: Health Mechanics & Eating System

### Phase 1: Eat Command (IMMEDIATE)
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 hours

**Implementation:**
- Add "eat" command to commands.json
- Create handleEatCommand() function
- Check item.eatable property
- Apply item.actions.eat effects:
  - Add health (addHealth property)
  - Remove item (removeItem property)
- Update health score display
- Implement health bounds (0-100?)

### Phase 2: Health Effects System
**Implementation ideas:**
- Health degrades over time?
- Walking costs health?
- Different foods restore different amounts
- Health affects total score
- Game over at 0 health?

### Phase 3: Scavenger Hunt Completion
**Implementation:**
- Track found items via item.found property
- Display scavenger progress (X/10 found)
- Bonus points for completing hunt
- Victory condition when all found

### Phase 4: Use Command for Doorbell/Knocker
**Implementation:**
- Add "use" command
- Handle actions.ring, actions.push, actions.knock
- Trigger special events (door opens, NPC appears)
- Puzzle progression mechanics

## Testing Status & Notes

### âœ… Confirmed Working
- **Drop command** - Full validation and room placement
- **Multi-component scoring** - Correctly separates regular/scavenger/health
- **Score panel display** - Clean breakdown with separator line
- **Item properties** - Streamlined to active properties only
- **Health initialization** - Defaults to 100 correctly
- **Inventory display** - Shows (+X) points format

### ðŸ”§ Development Notes
- **isScavengerItem flag** - Runtime property added during load
- **CONFIG_FALLBACKS** - Now matches runtimePlayerData structure
- **Status panel height** - May need adjustment if more stats added
- **Point values** - Scavenger items: 11-20, Regular treats: 0-1

- specifications-technical.md (updated with implementation details)

## Context for Next Claude Code Session

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Complete item interaction system (take/drop/examine) + multi-component scoring system with Treats, Scavenger Hunt, and Health tracking. The game now has meaningful progression mechanics.

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**:
1. Implement "eat" command with health effects
2. Add health bounds and game over condition
3. Implement scavenger hunt completion tracking
4. Add "use" command for doorbell/knocker interactions
5. Consider health degradation mechanics

**Key architectural success**:
- INVENTORY-as-room approach continues to work excellently
- Score component separation enables rich gameplay mechanics
- Item property system provides fine-grained control
- Runtime flagging (isScavengerItem) keeps JSON clean

**Critical insight**: Health as a score component creates interesting risk/reward - eating candy increases treats score but uses up health-restoring items. This could drive strategic gameplay decisions.

**Files ready for enhancement**:
- items.json and scavengerItems.json have health/eatable properties
- textAdventure.js has robust multi-component scoring
- Player structure supports health tracking
- All game data validated and loading correctly

The foundation is rock-solid and the scoring system provides a framework for rich gameplay mechanics. Ready to implement eating system and health effects!
