## Major Feature: Scavenger Item Gating

**Problem:** Players could see and collect scavenger items immediately without getting Mrs. McGillicutty's list.

**Solution:** All scavenger items now start with `includeInGame: false`

**Implementation:**
- Modified `scavengerItems.json`: All 9 items set to `includeInGame: false`
- Modified `handleExamineCommand` (textAdventure.js:2082-2089):
  - When player examines `mrsmcgillicuttyslist`, enables all scavenger items
  - Sets `item.includeInGame = true` for all items where `type === "scavenger"`

**Flow:**
1. Player rings doorbell at NICE-PORCH
2. Mrs. McGillicutty gives list + 2 candies
3. Player examines list → scavenger items become visible
4. Now player can find and collect all 9 items

---

## Major Feature: Context-Aware HOME Screen Messages

**Problem:** Generic time messages didn't reflect player performance (scavenger items collected).

**Solution:** Six different Atticus responses based on time + items collected.

**Implementation (textAdventure.js:2039-2084):**

**ON TIME scenarios:**
- **All 9 items:** "Atticus beams with pride that you found all nine scavenger hunt items, but is even prouder that you respected his 'home time' curfew."
- **Some items (1-8):** "Atticus looks you over and says: I'm glad you are back on time. I was getting worried. And it looks like you found some of those scavenger hunt items that Arthur put out!."
- **0 items:** "Atticus smiles: 'Right on time! You made it with X minute(s) to spare!'"

**LATE scenarios:**
- **All 9 items:** "I was getting worried about the time! I'm glad you are home and safe though. Arthur will be impressed you found all nine scavenger hunt items. We'll discuss your missing the curfew later tonite."
- **Some items (1-8):** "Atticus looks concerned: 'Where have you been? Mr. Radley's scavenger hunt shouldn't have taken that long. We'll talk later.'"
- **0 items:** "Atticus frowns: 'I was getting worried. You're late and it looks like you didn't participate in the scavenger hunt at all. What were you doing all that time?'"

**Key Fix:** Added `&& scavengerItems.length > 0` check to prevent 0 === 0 false positive.

---

## Major Feature: Puzzle Examination Requirements

**Problem:** Players could use puzzle solutions without discovering the clues.

**Solution:** Added `hasBeenExamined` flags with no time penalties for failed attempts.

### 1. Stereo System Buttons (MUSIC-ROOM)

**Files Modified:**
- `items.json` line 214: Added `"hasBeenExamined": false` to musicsystem
- `textAdventure.js` lines 2300-2303: Set flag when examined
- `textAdventure.js` lines 1706-1725: Gate press commands before examination

**Flow:**
1. Player tries `press music` → Error: "I don't see any 'music' button. Maybe you should examine something?"
2. Player types `examine stereo` → Sees button descriptions
3. Now `press music`, `press game`, `press movie` work
4. **No time penalty** for failed attempts (no `lastCommandSucceeded = true`)

### 2. Secret Door Password (MUSIC-ROOM)

**Files Modified:**
- `items.json` line 392: Added `"hasBeenExamined": false` to passwordpaper
- `textAdventure.js` lines 2243-2246: Set flag when examined (inventory items)
- `textAdventure.js` lines 2305-2308: Set flag when examined (fixed items - redundant safety)
- `textAdventure.js` lines 1799-1820: Two-stage gate for "say friend"

**Flow:**
1. Player must first have parchment in inventory
2. Player must then examine parchment to read "Speak, friend, and enter"
3. Only then can `say friend` unlock the secret door
4. **No time penalty** for failed attempts

---

## UI Improvements

### 1. Compass Display Enhancement
**File:** `textAdventure.js` line 2764

**Before:**
```
            (s)outh         HOME
```

**After:**
```
SCORE        (s)outh        HOME
```

Players now see SCORE command prominently displayed in navigation area.

### 2. HOME Screen Always Shows Inventory
**File:** `textAdventure.js` lines 1982-2024

**Before:** Only showed inventory sections if player had items
**After:** Always shows both sections with helpful messages:
- "You did not collect any scavenger items." (when 0/9)
- "You did not collect any treats." (when 0/20)

### 3. Fixed Scavenger Count Display
**File:** `textAdventure.js` lines 1977-1980

**Before:**
```javascript
const totalScavenger = Object.values(items).filter(
  (item) => item.includeInGame && item.type === "scavenger"
).length;
```
This showed 0/0 at game start since items weren't included yet.

**After:**
```javascript
const totalScavenger = Object.values(items).filter(
  (item) => item.type === "scavenger"
).length;
```
Now always shows correct 0/9 count.

## Food & Time Balance Improvements

### Premium Apple Enhancement
**File:** `items.json` lines 678-690

**Changes:**
1. Added `timer: -4` to eat action (was default -2)
2. Updated examine text: "Much better for you than all that sugary candy. This should shave a few minutes off your time."
3. Updated eat response: "You feel energized and ready to move faster!"

**Strategic Value:**
- **Regular candy:** +1 minute net gain (pickup +1, eat -2)
- **Apple:** +3 minutes net gain (pickup +1, eat -4)
- **3x better than regular candy!**
- Plus 6 health (highest in game)

**Location:** DINING-ROOM (thematically appropriate)

---

## Bug Fixes

### 1. START Room Text Cleanup
**File:** `rooms-w-doors.json` line 20

Removed redundant phrase "The light is coming from across the street." from lookText.

### 2. DEBUG Command Fix
**File:** `textAdventure.js` lines 1305-1310

Added code to enable scavenger items before adding them to inventory:
```javascript
// First, enable all scavenger items in the game
Object.values(items).forEach(item => {
  if (item.type === "scavenger") {
    item.includeInGame = true;
  }
});
```

This fixes DEBUG working at game start when scavenger items are disabled.

---
