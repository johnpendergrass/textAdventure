# The Radley House - To Be Continued
## Session: October 7, 2025 - 14:00

### Current State: v0.34 - INTRO Room Removed

The game has been streamlined by removing the intermediate INTRO room. Players now move directly from START to STREET-01, creating a tighter, more focused introduction to the game.

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Changes Made

**rooms-w-doors.json:**
1. Deleted INTRO room (was lines 30-44)
2. Modified START room exits: `east` now points to STREET-01 via start2street-01 door
3. Modified STREET-01 room:
   - Updated first-time text to include INTRO's instructional hints
   - Changed west exit from INTRO to START
   - Fixed typo
4. Deleted start2intro door (was lines 300-306)

6. Added start2street-01 door (new definition)

**No other files changed** - items, doors, and game mechanics remain intact.

### Room Flow (Updated)
New player progression:
```
START ‚Üí STREET-01 ‚Üí STREET-02 (Radley House)
            ‚Üì
      NICE-PORCH (Mrs. McGillicutty's)
```

### Design Rationale

**Why remove INTRO?**
- Redundant transitional space
- Instructions can be delivered in STREET-01 where they're more relevant
- Tighter pacing - players reach first meaningful location faster
- Simpler mental model of the game world
- One less room to maintain and document

## Known Issues / Limitations

**None identified** - INTRO removal was clean with no side effects.

---

## Immediate ToDo Items

### 1. **Polish Introduction Text** üé®
**START room:**
- Review welcome message length and pacing
- Consider if the centered title needs adjustment
- Ensure the light-down-the-street hook is compelling

**STREET-01 room:**
- Review integrated instructional text flow
- Make sure command hints are clear but not overwhelming
- Ensure smooth transition from START

### 2. **Change Safe Combination** üîê
**Current combination:** 13-97-55 (stored as "139755" in code)
- Located in: `textAdventure.js` line 1370
- Need to decide on new combination
- Should be memorable but not obvious
- Clues should be updated accordingly in items

**Implementation:**
- Update `handleSayCommand()` function
- Update any hint items that reference the combination
- Test to ensure new combination works

### 3. **Improve Scoring System** üèÜ
**Current scoring:**
- Scavenger Items: X / 9
- Treats: X / 20

**Improvements needed:**
- Calculate a nice round final score (100 points? 1000 points?)
- Weight scavenger items more heavily than treats
- Possible scoring ideas:
  - Scavenger items: 10 points each (90 points total)
  - Treats: 0.5 points each (10 points total)
  - Total: 100 points possible
- Add scoring calculation function
- Display final score on HOME screen
- Consider bonus points for:
  - Finding all items
  - Completing puzzles
  - Opening safe

## Long-Term ToDo Items

**Content Enhancements:**
- Review all room descriptions for consistency
- Ensure narrative flow makes sense after INTRO removal
- Consider if other rooms could be combined/simplified

**Polish:**
- Playtest the new START ‚Üí STREET-01 flow
- Get feedback on pacing
- Verify all hints are clear

**Documentation:**
- Update specifications.md with INTRO removal
- Update room count from 14 to 13 throughout docs
- Document the simplified navigation flow

**Technical:**
- Consider implementing save game system
- Achievement tracking
- High score display

---

## Version Tracking

**Previous version:** v0.33 (New START Room & Enhanced Introductions)
**Current version:** v0.34 (INTRO Room Removed & Streamlined Navigation)

**Key changes from v0.33:**
- Removed INTRO room completely
- Simplified door structure (13 doors instead of 14)
- Enhanced START and STREET-01 text

- Direct START ‚Üí STREET-01 connection

## Safe Combination Details (For Next Steps)

**Current Implementation:**
- **File:** textAdventure.js
- **Line:** 1370
- **Current code:** `normalizedPhrase === "139755"`
- **Displayed as:** "13-97-55"
- **Location:** STUDY room
- **Reveals:** Krugerrand (scavenger item) + password parchment

**When changing:**
1. Update line 1370 with new number (no spaces/dashes)
2. Update line 1373 with formatted display version
3. Search for any clue items that reference the combination
4. Test both correct and incorrect combinations

## Notes for Next Session

**Priorities:**
1. Clean up START and STREET-01 text for better flow
2. Choose and implement new safe combination
3. Design and implement point-based scoring system

**Game state:**
- All core functionality working perfectly
- No bugs introduced by INTRO removal
- Ready for text polish and scoring implementation

**Files modified this session:**
- HALLOWEEN-GAME/rooms-w-doors.json (major restructuring)
