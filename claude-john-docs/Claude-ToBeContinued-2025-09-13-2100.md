# Text Adventure Game - Doors System Design & Architecture Insights

## Current State of Project

We have made significant progress on the **doors system design** and achieved critical **architectural clarity** for the Halloween text adventure game. The foundational single-source architecture is complete, and we now have a solid doors/navigation system ready for implementation.

## Major Accomplishments Completed (September 13, 2025 Evening)

### âœ… Doors System Implementation Complete
**rooms-w-doors.json validated and enhanced:**
- **Fixed JSON syntax error** in KITCHEN room (missing closing brace)
- **Added description field** to all 13 doors with appropriate text:
  - Outdoor pathways: "It is a sidewalk.", "It is a walkway to the porch."
  - Building entrances: "It is a front door.", "It is a heavy front door."
  - Interior doors: "It is a door." (simple and generic as requested)
  - Secret door: Kept existing special messages system
- **Validated all connections** - Every room exit properly references existing doors
- **Confirmed navigation paths** - All 15 rooms are reachable through the door system

### âœ… Critical Architectural Insight Achieved
**"Single Source of Truth" Redefined:**
- **Key realization**: Single source â‰  Single file, Single source = NO DUPLICATION
- **Multiple files are BETTER** when they have clear separation of concerns
- **The real principle**: Each piece of data exists in exactly ONE place
- **What matters**: No duplication, clear ownership, no sync issues
- **What doesn't matter**: File count or file size (within reason)

### âœ… File Organization Strategy Clarified
**Current optimal structure identified:**
- **rooms-w-doors.json** (9KB) - ALL navigation, topology, doors, puzzles
- **gameData.json** (8KB) - ALL game content (items, NPCs, commands)
- **Supporting files** - ASCII art, UI config, keyboard shortcuts
- **Clean separation**: Navigation/barriers vs Game content/mechanics

## Current File Architecture (Finalized)

### Core Game Files
- **gameData.json** - Single source for all dynamic game content
  - Commands with includeInGame flags
  - Items with startLocation properties
  - NPCs with actions and locations
  - Startup configuration
- **rooms-w-doors.json** - Complete navigation system
  - 15 rooms with enterText (first/repeat), lookText, exits
  - 13 doors with descriptions, visibility, lock states
  - Puzzle system (say-friend puzzle for secret door)
  - Requirements and effects system

### Supporting Configuration
- **asciiArt.txt** - ASCII art library
- **asciiArtConfig.json** - Display settings
- **uiConfig.json** - UI labels
- **keyboardShortcuts.json** - Key bindings

### Runtime Files (Auto-created)
- **player.json** - Save game data
- **gameState.json** - World state

## Architecture Benefits Achieved

### Perfect Separation of Concerns
- **Navigation logic** completely separate from **game content**
- **Swappable maps** - Change rooms-w-doors.json for different worlds
- **Swappable content** - Change gameData.json for different items/NPCs
- **Clear boundaries** - Know exactly where to find/change anything

### Advanced Door System Features
- **Bidirectional consistency** - Door IDs shared between room exits
- **State management** - visible/invisible, locked/unlocked
- **Puzzle integration** - Requirements and effects system
- **Extensible design** - Easy to add new door types and mechanics

## Next Development Priorities (IMMEDIATE - Tomorrow's Work)

### ðŸšª PRIORITY 1: Finalize JSON File Organization
**Decision needed:**
- **Option A**: Keep current structure (rooms-w-doors.json + gameData.json)
- **Option B**: Merge doors/puzzles into gameData.json, update rooms.json
- **Recommendation**: Keep Option A - clean separation is architecturally superior

### ðŸŽ® PRIORITY 2: Implement Movement-Only Game Engine
**Basic navigation system to build:**

**Core Movement Functions Needed:**
```javascript
function processMovement(direction) {
  // 1. Get current room from gameState
  // 2. Get exit for direction from rooms data
  // 3. Find door by door ID
  // 4. Check door visibility (can player see it?)
  // 5. Check door locked state (can player pass?)
  // 6. If valid: update current room, display enterText
  // 7. If blocked: display appropriate door message
}

function examineRoom() {
  // 1. Display current room lookText
  // 2. List visible exits (check door visibility)
  // 3. Show items in room (from gameData startLocation)
  // 4. Show NPCs in room (from gameData startLocation)
}

function showHelp() {
  // Display available commands: north, south, east, west, look, help
}
```

**State Management:**
- Load rooms-w-doors.json for navigation data
- Load gameData.json for items/NPCs in rooms
- Track currentRoom in gameState.json
- Track visitedRooms for first/repeat enterText
- Track door states for puzzles/unlocking

### ðŸŽ¯ Success Criteria for Movement Engine
- **Player can navigate** all 15 rooms using n/s/e/w commands
- **Door blocking works** - locked front door prevents entry to foyer
- **Room descriptions** show proper lookText and visible exits
- **First/repeat text** works correctly based on visit history
- **Items/NPCs appear** in rooms based on startLocation from gameData
- **Help command** shows available movement commands

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Door System Processing Flow
```javascript
// Movement validation process:
1. Player types "north"
2. Get currentRoom.exits.north.door (door ID)
3. Lookup door in doors section by ID
4. Check door.visible (false = "You don't see a way to go north")
5. Check door.locked (true = show door.description "It is a heavy front door." + "It's locked")
6. If requirements exist, check if met
7. If all pass: move to new room, show enterText, update gameState
```

### Integration with Existing Architecture
- **gameData.json processing** - Use existing includeInGame filtering
- **ASCII art integration** - Update art based on room or events
- **Save/load system** - Persist currentRoom and door states
- **Command system** - Extend existing command parsing for movement

## Files to Preserve for Next Session

**Keep the 3 most recent ToBeContinued files:**
- Claude-ToBeContinued-2025-09-13-2100.md (this file)
- Claude-ToBeContinued-2025-09-13.md (today's earlier version)
- Claude-ToBeContinued-2025-09-12.md

**Update specifications file** with final doors architecture and movement engine requirements.

## Context for Next Claude Code Session

The **architecture foundation is complete and optimized**. We have:
- **Perfect single-source principle** (no duplication anywhere)
- **Clean separation of concerns** (navigation vs content)
- **Robust doors system** with puzzles and state management
- **All data validated** and ready for engine implementation

**The immediate next milestone** is implementing the **movement-only game engine** that processes north/south/east/west commands, validates door passages, updates room state, and displays appropriate text responses.

This will create the first playable version where players can walk through the 15-room world with proper door handling, locked barriers, and room state management.

**Key architectural insight to remember**: Multiple well-organized files with no duplication is superior to one monolithic file. Clean separation enables better maintainability, swappable content, and clearer code organization.
