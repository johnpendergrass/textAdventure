# Halloween Text Adventure - TypedNames Array Migration & Item Expansion

## Current State of Project

Today's session focused on **major system refactoring** and **content expansion**. We unified all item naming to use `typedNames` arrays, added 22 new candy/food items with images, and improved the command parsing to handle multi-word inputs flexibly.

## Major Accomplishments Completed (October 1, 2025)

### ✅ Universal typedNames Array Migration

**Problem solved:** Mixed naming system was inconsistent and limiting
- Old system: Some items had `typedName` string, others `typedName` array (from user edits)
- New system: ALL items use `typedNames` array uniformly

**Files modified:**
- **items.json** - Converted 7 legacy items to typedNames arrays
- **scavengerItems.json** - Renamed property from `typedName` to `typedNames` (all 11 items)
- **textAdventure.js** - Simplified 3 functions to single-check pattern

**Benefits achieved:**
- Consistent structure across all 29 items + 11 scavenger items
- Every item can have multiple aliases
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Natural language flexibility for players

**Example transformation:**
```json
// Before
"doorbell": {
  "typedName": "doorbell"
}

// After
"doorbell": {
  "typedNames": ["doorbell", "bell", "button", "ringer"]
}
```

### ✅ 22 New Items Added to Game

**Content expansion complete:**
- Started with 7 items (bag, doorbell, lights, knocker, snickers, whatchamacallit)
- Added 22 new candy/food items from assets/items folder
- **Total now: 29 items**

**New items (all with icon150 property):**
1. 100grand - 100 Grand bar
2. 3musketeers - 3 Musketeers bar
3. butterfinger - Butterfinger bar
4. mars - Mars bar
5. mounds - Mounds bar
6. mrgoodbar - Mr. Goodbar
7. apple - Red apple (healthy treat!)
8. corn - Ear of corn (odd Halloween treat)
9. gummybears - Gummy Bears
10. hersheykisses - Hershey's Kisses
11. hotdog - Hot dog (weird but edible)
12. jollyrancher - Jolly Rancher
13. lemondrops - Lemon Drops
14. lifesavers - Life Savers
15. popcorn - Popcorn
16. reesespieces - Reese's Pieces
17. rottentomato - Rotten tomato (negative health!)
18. skittles - Skittles
19. smarties - Smarties
20. socks - Dirty socks (not eatable)
21. spicedrops - Spice Drops
22. twizzlers - Twizzlers

**Item distribution across rooms:**
- DINING-ROOM: 100grand, apple, lemondrops, smarties
- STUDY: 3musketeers, gummybears, lifesavers
- KITCHEN: butterfinger, corn, reesespieces
- GAME-ROOM: mars, hersheykisses, popcorn, twizzlers
- BEDROOM: mounds, jollyrancher, rottentomato, spicedrops
- TV-ROOM: mrgoodbar, hotdog, skittles, socks
- FOYER: snickers (original)
- LIBRARY: whatchamacallit (original)
- MUSIC-ROOM: candy_bag (original)

### ✅ icon150 Property Added

**All items now reference 150px dimension images:**
- Property: `"icon150": "assets/items/[filename]150.png"`
- Prepared for future image display during examine command
- 24 images verified in assets/items folder
- All images have 150 in width or height dimension (one is 149, close enough)

**Ready for implementation:**
- Inline display during examine
- Status panel display
- Inventory visualization

### ✅ Enhanced Multi-Word Command Parsing

**Improved natural language processing:**

**Old system:**
```javascript
const words = command.split(/\s+/);
const targetName = words[1]; // Only gets second word!
// "take gummy bears" → only checks "gummy"
```

**New system:**
```javascript
const input = command.toLowerCase().trim();
const firstSpace = input.indexOf(' ');
const remainder = input.substring(firstSpace + 1).trim();
const targetName = remainder.replace(/\s+/g, ''); // Strip ALL spaces
// "take gummy bears" → checks "gummybears" ✓
// "take Reese's Pieces" → checks "reesespieces" ✓
```

**Now works perfectly:**
- `take gummy bears` → `gummybears`
- `take reeses pieces` → `reesespieces`
- `take 100 grand` → `100grand`
- `examine mr goodbar` → `mrgoodbar`

**Unique typedNames prevent conflicts:**
- Each item has distinctive primary name
- Avoided generic terms like "candy" or "bar" alone
- Porch lights distinguished: "nicelight" vs "eerielight"

### ✅ Scavenger Items Updated

**All 11 scavenger items converted to typedNames:**
- nvidia - NVidia 5090 Video Card
- beatles - Beatles Revolver Music CD
- catmug - Cat Mug
- cuponoodles - Cup O' Noodles
- watch - Fancy Watch
- bringingupbaby - Bringing Up Baby DVD (fixed from "item6")
- dog - Odd Dog figurine
- krugerrand - Krugerrand gold coin
- pumpkin - Decorative Pumpkin
- gamingmouse - Razer Gaming Mouse
- frankenstein - Frankenstein book

**Each has 4-9 aliases:**
```json
"krugerrand": {
  "typedNames": ["krugerrand", "coin", "goldcoin", "gold", "currency"]
}
```

### ✅ Code Simplification

**Unified filtering pattern in 3 functions:**
```javascript
// Before (dual check)
(item.typedNames?.includes(target) || item.typedName === target)

// After (single check)
item.typedNames?.includes(target)
```

**Functions updated:**
- handleTakeCommand() - line ~718
- handleDropCommand() - line ~770
- handleExamineCommand() - line ~814

**Lines of code reduced:** ~12 lines cleaner, more maintainable

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### Browser Caching Issue

**Problem:** Updated JSON files not loading in browser
- Modified scavengerItems.json from `typedName` to `typedNames`
- Browser served cached old version
- Commands failed silently

**Solution methods tested:**
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) - sometimes works
2. Port rotation (8000 → 8001 → 8002) - bypasses cache
3. Clear cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete) - most reliable
4. Incognito mode - guaranteed fresh load

**Lesson learned:** Browser caching of localhost is aggressive. Always test with cache clear during JSON development.

- Full names: `take gummy bears`, `examine reeses pieces`
- Variations: `take 100 grand` or `take grand`
- Aliases: `take coin` for krugerrand, `take dog` for odd dog

### ✅ Example Session
```
> north
You enter the Radley House foyer.
Exits: south, north, east, west
You see:
  Snickers mini-bar
  Odd Dog

> get snickers
You pick up the Snickers bar and put it in your trick or treat bag.

> take dog
You pick up the oddly shaped ceramic dog and put it in your bag.

> inventory
You are carrying:
  Snickers mini-bar (+1)
  Odd Dog (+10)

> north
You enter the library.

> examine whatchamacallit
You need to pick up the Whatchamacallit bar first to examine it closely.

> take whatchamacallit
You pick up the Whatchamacallit bar and put it in your trick or treat bag.

> examine whatchamacallit
Whatchamacallit bar: Crispy rice and caramel covered in chocolate. An unusual but tasty choice.
```

## NEXT PRIORITY: Visual Scoring & Scavenger Checklist

### Phase 1: Updated Score Display (IMMEDIATE)

**Current scoring needs update:**
- Treats score calculation outdated (was 2 max, now 24 max)
- Need to display found vs total scavenger items
- Health still working correctly at 100

**Proposed new score panel:**
```
SCORE:
Treats: 5/24
Scavenger: 3/11
Health: 100
───────────
Score: 138
```

**Implementation tasks:**
1. Update scoring logic to show "X/Total" format
2. Calculate current vs maximum for treats
3. Track found scavenger items (item.found property)
4. Display ratio for scavenger hunt progress

### Phase 2: Visual Scavenger Checklist (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Goal:** Replace text list with visual grid in .scavenger div

**Design options:**
1. **Simple list with checkboxes** (easiest)
   - Item name + checkbox/checkmark
   - Updates when item found
   - Minimal CSS changes

2. **Icon-based grid** (more complex, deferred from Sept 30)
   - 3×3 or 3×4 grid of icons
   - Grayscale/hidden when not found
   - Color/visible when found
   - Uses icon90x90 images

**Recommendation:** Start with Option 1 (checkboxes), can enhance to Option 2 later

**Current .scavenger div available:**
- Size: 313px × 280px
- Currently unused
- Perfect for checklist display

### Phase 3: Eat Command Implementation (DEFERRED)

**Already prepared:**
- All candy items have `eatable: true`
- All have `actions.eat` with health effects
- Health tracking in player.core.health

**Needs implementation:**
- Add "eat" command to commands.json
- Create handleEatCommand() function
- Apply health changes (addHealth property)
- Remove item from inventory (removeItem: true)
- Bounds checking (health 0-100)
- Game over at 0 health

### Phase 4: Image Display During Examine (FUTURE)

**Assets ready:**
- icon150 property on all items
- 24 images in assets/items folder
- 150px dimension perfect for inline display

**Implementation approaches:**
1. Inline in text buffer (simple)
2. Temporary overlay (more prominent)
3. Dedicated display area (permanent)

**Defer until after scoring and checklist complete**

## Testing Notes

### ✅ Verified Working
- **typedNames arrays** - All 40 items (29 regular + 11 scavenger) use unified structure
- **Multi-word parsing** - "take gummy bears", "examine 100 grand" work perfectly
- **Alias matching** - All aliases functional
- **Space stripping** - Handles any spacing in input
- **Take/drop/examine** - All three commands working with new system

### 🔧 To Test
- Score panel with X/Total format
- Scavenger found counting
- Visual checklist display
- Eat command (when implemented)
- Image display (when implemented)

## Browser Development Notes

**Cache management critical:**
- localhost caching very aggressive
- JSON file updates often cached
- Always test with cache clear (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Alternative: rotate ports (8000, 8001, 8002...)
- Incognito mode guarantees fresh load

**Development workflow:**
1. Make JSON changes
2. Validate JSON syntax: `python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('file.json'))"`
3. Clear browser cache OR use new port
4. Hard refresh page
5. Test in console if uncertain: `items.itemname`

## Files to Preserve for Next Session

**Keep the 3 most recent ToBeContinued files:**
- Claude-ToBeContinued-2025-10-01.md (this file - LATEST)
- Claude-ToBeContinued-2025-09-30.md (location property refactoring)
- Claude-ToBeContinued-2025-09-29-1800.md (scoring system)
- ~~Claude-ToBeContinued-2025-09-29-1652.md~~ (DELETE - oldest)

**Current specifications:**
- specifications.md (needs update with new items)
- specifications-technical.md (needs update with parsing changes)

## Context for Next Claude Code Session

**MAJOR REFACTORING COMPLETE**: All items now use unified `typedNames` array structure. System is consistent, flexible, and maintainable. Content expanded from 7 to 29 regular items plus 11 scavenger items.

**NATURAL LANGUAGE WORKING**: Multi-word parsing with space stripping enables flexible input. Players can type items naturally ("gummy bears", "reeses pieces", "100 grand") and commands work intuitively.

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS**:
1. Update score display to show "X/Total" format for Treats and Scavenger
2. Implement visual scavenger checklist in .scavenger div (checkbox style)
3. Test and refine scoring calculations
4. Add eat command for candy consumption
5. Consider image display during examine command

**Key architectural decisions**:
- Universal typedNames arrays eliminate special cases
- Space-stripping parser handles all input formats
- icon150 property ready for future image display
- Scavenger items have dual icons (90×90 and 250×250)

**Assets ready for use**:
- 24 candy/food images at 150px dimension
- 12 scavenger items with dual-size icons
- All items have 2-9 aliases for flexibility

The game is now feature-rich with diverse items, natural language input, and ready for visual enhancements to scoring and scavenger hunt progress tracking!
