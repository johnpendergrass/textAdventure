# Claude-ToBeContinued - 2025-10-10-1800

## Current State - v0.38 TIME-BASED SCORING SYSTEM COMPLETE! ✅

**The Radley House** Halloween text adventure game now features a fully functional time-based scoring system! The player must race against the clock to get home by 8:30 PM deadline.

### Git Status
**Branch:** main
**Last Commit:** (Ready for commit - time system complete)
**Status:** All time mechanics implemented and tested ✅

### Recent Session Work (Oct 10, 2025 - Evening)

#### Major Achievement: TIME-BASED SCORING SYSTEM ✅

**Complete Implementation (13/13 tasks done):**

1. ✅ Time constants and state variables
2. ✅ Time calculation helper functions
3. ✅ Commands.json timer properties for all commands
4. ✅ Command timer processing in handleInput
5. ✅ EAT command consecutive limit logic (max 5 before moving)
6. ✅ Movement resets eat counter
7. ✅ SCORE command with time explanation
8. ✅ Digital clock UI in status panel
9. ✅ Green LCD clock CSS styling (22px font, reduced from 32px)
10. ✅ START room text updated with time deadline
11. ✅ HOME screen time-based success/failure messages
12. ✅ Game time initialization on startup
13. ✅ SCORE command auto-shows room description after info

#### Time System Features:

**Core Mechanics:**
- **Start Time:** 7:57 PM (19:57 in 24-hour format)
- **Deadline:** 8:30 PM (20:30)
- **Time Window:** 33 minutes to complete the game
- **Digital Clock:** Green LCD display (22px font) updates in real-time
- **12-hour Format:** Shows "7:57 PM" style time

**Command Timing:**
- Movement commands (N/S/E/W): +1 minute
- Action commands (TAKE, EXAMINE, USE, OPEN, etc.): +1 minute
- Free commands (LOOK, HELP, INVENTORY, SCORE): 0 minutes
- EAT command: -2 minutes (default, item-specific timers override)
- QUIT/HOME: +2 minutes
- **Failed commands:** 0 minutes (no penalty!)

**Special EAT Mechanics:**
- Standard candy: -2 minutes (net gain of 1 minute after +1 for pickup)
- Max 5 consecutive eats before requiring movement
- 6th eat attempt blocked with message: "You cannot just gorge yourself on candy! Five is the limit here! Get moving!"
- Movement or HOME resets eat counter

**Item-Specific Timing:**
```javascript
// Rotten Tomato (TRAP!)
timer: 1  // +1 minute penalty
addHealth: -5
Net effect: LOSE 2 minutes + health damage!

// Hot Dog (WORTHLESS)
timer: 0  // No time benefit
addHealth: 0
Net effect: Waste 1 minute picking it up

// Canned Corn (NEUTRAL)
timer: -1  // Gives back 1 minute
addHealth: 0
removeItem: false  // Keeps item
Net effect: 0 minutes (cancels out pickup time)
Message: "What? You can't eat a can of corn! You'll have to take this home for Calpurnia to cook."
```

**Success Tracking:**
- `lastCommandSucceeded` flag prevents time penalties on failed commands
- 34 success checkpoint locations throughout all command handlers
- Commands only consume time when they actually work

**UI Updates:**
- Digital clock replaces old SCORE section in status panel
- SCORE command shows:
  - Current time
  - Deadline (8:30 PM)
  - Time remaining
  - How timing works
  - Current progress (scavenger items, treats)
  - Auto-LOOK after displaying info
- HOME screen shows different messages based on deadline:
  - Made it: "Right on time! You made it with X minute(s) to spare!"
  - Missed it: "You're X minute(s) late! I told you to be home by 8:30!"

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Code Locations:

**Time Constants (textAdventure.js:8-11):**
```javascript
const GAME_START_TIME = { hours: 19, minutes: 57 };  // 7:57 PM
const GAME_DEADLINE = { hours: 20, minutes: 30 };     // 8:30 PM
const MAX_CONSECUTIVE_EATS = 5;
```

**Time State Variables (textAdventure.js:47-54):**
```javascript
let gameTime = {
  hours: 19,
  minutes: 57,
  totalMinutes: 1197  // 19*60 + 57 = 1197 (7:57 PM)
};
let consecutiveEatsCounter = 0;
let lastCommandSucceeded = false;
```

**Time Functions (textAdventure.js:842-868):**
- `updateGameTime(minutesToAdd)` - Updates game clock
- `formatTime12Hour()` - Formats as "7:57 PM"
- `updateClockDisplay()` - Updates UI

**EAT Command (textAdventure.js:1524-1607):**
- Checks consecutive eat limit FIRST
- Item-specific timer support: `item.actions.eat.timer`
- Defaults to -2 minutes if no timer specified
- Updates consecutiveEatsCounter on success

**Timer Processing (textAdventure.js:2857-2939):**
- Resets `lastCommandSucceeded` before each command
- Each handler sets flag to `true` on success
- Timer only applied if command succeeded AND timer defined
- EAT excluded from auto-processing (handles internally)

**Digital Clock CSS (textAdventure.css:423-443):**
- 22px font (reduced from 32px to prevent overflow)
- Green LCD style (#00ff00 color)
- Dark green background (#0a2a0a)
- Green glow text-shadow effect

**SCORE Command (textAdventure.js:1482-1527):**
- Shows time info, rules, and progress
- Auto-calls `lookAtRoom()` at end
- Blank line separator before room description

## Game Balance & Strategy

**Time Budget Analysis:**
- **33 minutes available** (7:57 PM → 8:30 PM)
- **Minimum commands to win:** ~40-50 (movement + item collection)
  - Navigate to all rooms: ~15-20 moves
  - Collect 9 scavenger items: 9 takes
  - Solve puzzles: ~5-10 commands
  - Return home: ~5 moves
- **Without candy:** Would run out of time!
- **With candy strategy:** Must collect and eat 16+ candies to have enough time
  - Each candy eaten: Net +1 minute
  - 16 candies eaten: Gain 16 minutes
  - Total time: 33 + 16 = 49 minutes available

**Strategic Considerations:**
- Players MUST find and eat candy to succeed
- Rotten tomato is a trap (loses 2 minutes + health)
- Hot dog is a waste (no benefit)
- Canned corn is neutral (good for completionists)
- LOOK, HELP, INVENTORY are free (encourage exploration)
- 5-eat limit adds tactical planning (can't just spam eating)
