# Claude ToBeContinued - 2025-10-04 (Evening Session)
# SAY Command, Safe Combination Puzzle & Inventory Display Enhancements

## Current State of Project

Today's evening session focused on implementing the SAY command system with safe combination and secret door password puzzles. We also added a scavenger item location swap (dog/krugerrand) and enhanced inventory display with bold keyword highlighting for quest items.

## Major Accomplishments Completed (October 4, 2025 - Evening)

### ✅ SAY Command Implementation

**Problem solved:** Need interactive puzzles where players type actual combinations and passwords instead of just "use item".

**Command Definition (commands.json):**
```json
"say": {
  "includeInGame": true,
  "type": "action",
  "shortcuts": ["speak"],
  "action": "say_phrase"
}
```

**Implementation (textAdventure.js ~line 1015-1100):**
- Extracts phrase after SAY keyword
- Normalizes input (removes spaces, dashes, converts to lowercase)
- Context-sensitive: only works at specific locations
- Flexible matching: "13-97-55", "139755", "13 97 55" all work

**Player Experience:**
- Type `SAY 13-97-55` at STUDY → opens safe
- Type `SAY FRIEND` at MUSIC-ROOM → reveals and unlocks secret door
- Type SAY anywhere else → "Nothing happens."

**Files modified:**
- commands.json - Added SAY command with "speak" alias
- textAdventure.js - Added handleSayCommand() function and say_phrase case

### ✅ Safe & Combination Puzzle

**Problem solved:** Need a locked safe in STUDY that opens with a combination from the bookmark.

**Safe Item (items.json):**
```json
"safe": {
  "type": "fixed",
  "location": "STUDY",
  "hasBeenOpened": false,
  "actions": {
    "examine": "An old cast iron safe, used for valuables. It has an old fashioned rotary combination lock next to the handle. The dial shows numbers from 0 to 99."
  }
}
```

**Safe Opening Logic (textAdventure.js ~line 1030-1062):**
1. Player at STUDY + says "139755" → safe opens
2. Displays: "You dial the combination: 13-97-55"
3. Shows: "CLICK! The safe door swings open with a satisfying thunk."
4. Reveals krugerrand and password paper in STUDY (visible, need to be picked up)
5. Marks safe.hasBeenOpened = true
6. Calls lookAtRoom() to show new items

**After Opening:**
- Examine safe → "The safe door is open."

**Files modified:**
- items.json - Added safe item with dramatic examine text
- textAdventure.js - Added safe combination check in handleSayCommand()
- textAdventure.js - Added safe state check in handleExamineCommand()

### ✅ Bookmark with Combination

**Problem solved:** Bookmark needed to display combination in a visually distinctive format.

**Bookmark Design:**
```
-----------------------------------------------------------------
|\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/| 13-97-55 |\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\|
-----------------------------------------------------------------
```

**Implementation (items.json):**
```json
"oldnote": {
  "type": "notes",
  "display": "old bookmark",
  "location": "HIDDEN",
  "actions": {
    "examine": "-----------------------------------------------------------------\n|\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/| 13-97-55 |\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/|\n-----------------------------------------------------------------"
  }
}
```

**Player Experience:**
1. Examine Frankenstein book → reveals bookmark
2. Examine bookmark → see ornate bookmark with combination
3. Displayed in handwritten Caveat font with paper background

**Files modified:**
- items.json - Updated oldnote examine text with decorative bookmark design

### ✅ Password Paper

**Problem solved:** Need a paper in the safe with the secret door password.

**Password Paper Item (items.json):**
```json
"passwordpaper": {
  "type": "notes",
  "display": "password paper",
  "location": "HIDDEN",
  "visible": false,
  "actions": {
    "examine": "Speak, friend, and enter.",
    "take": {
      "response": "You carefully take the password paper.",
      "addToInventory": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Player Experience:**
1. Open safe → password paper appears in STUDY
2. Take password paper
3. Examine paper → see password phrase
4. Go to MUSIC-ROOM and say the password

**Files modified:**
- items.json - Created passwordpaper item with simple, mysterious text

### ✅ Secret Door Password Mechanic

**Problem solved:** Secret door needs password to unlock.

**Secret Door Configuration (rooms-w-doors.json):**
```json
"music-room2game-room": {
  "visible": false,    // Hidden initially
  "locked": true,      // Locked initially
  "requiresPuzzle": "say-friend"
}
```

**Password Logic (textAdventure.js ~line 1065-1093):**
- If at MUSIC-ROOM + phrase includes "friend" + door not visible → reveal & unlock door
- Supports flexible input: "friend", "speak friend", "speak friend and enter"
- Displays: "The wall rumbles and shakes! A hidden door swings open, revealing a passage north!"
- Sets door.visible = true, door.locked = false, door.open = true
- Calls lookAtRoom() to show new north exit

**Files modified:**
- textAdventure.js - Added secret door password check in handleSayCommand()

### ✅ Krugerrand & Dog Location Swap

**Problem solved:** Krugerrand needs to be hidden in safe, dog needs to be visible in BEDROOM.

**Changes (scavengerItems.json):**
- **Krugerrand**:
  - location: BEDROOM → HIDDEN
  - visible: true → false
  - Added: originalLocation: "STUDY" (for grid display)
- **Dog**:
  - location: STUDY → BEDROOM

**Grid Display Fix (textAdventure.js ~line 1942-1945):**
```javascript
// Only set originalLocation if not already defined (for items starting HIDDEN)
if (!item.originalLocation) {
  item.originalLocation = item.location;
}
```

**Result:**
- Dog appears in BEDROOM (grid square 2)
- Krugerrand appears in STUDY when safe opens (grid square 8)
- Grid correctly shows items in their designated squares

**Files modified:**
- scavengerItems.json - Swapped locations, added originalLocation to krugerrand
- textAdventure.js - Fixed originalLocation initialization to preserve manual settings

### ✅ Bold Keyword Highlighting in Inventory

**Problem solved:** Quest items need visual emphasis on keywords players should type.

**Implementation:**
Added `inventoryDisplay` property to 4 quest items with HTML bold tags:

**Items Updated (items.json):**
1. brass_key: `"inventoryDisplay": "brass <b>key</b>"`
2. oldnote: `"inventoryDisplay": "old <b>bookmark</b>"`
3. mrsmcgillicuttyslist: `"inventoryDisplay": "Mrs. McGillicutty's <b>list</b>"`
4. passwordpaper: `"inventoryDisplay": "<b>password</b> paper"`

**Display Logic (textAdventure.js ~line 801):**
```javascript
addToBuffer([{ text: `  ${item.inventoryDisplay || item.display}`, type: "flavor" }]);
```

**Result:**
When players type "i" or "inventory":
```
ITEMS
  brass key (with "key" in bold)
  old bookmark (with "bookmark" in bold)
  Mrs. McGillicutty's list (with "list" in bold)
  password paper (with "password" in bold)
```

**Files modified:**
- items.json - Added inventoryDisplay to 4 quest items
- textAdventure.js - Updated showInventory() to use inventoryDisplay when available

### ✅ Command Grid Layout Update

**Problem solved:** Need to add SAY command to status panel and relocate HOME.

**Previous Layout:**
```
(h)elp  (l)ook  (i)nventory
(t)ake  (d)rop  e(x)amine
(u)se   (e)at   HOME

      (n)orth
         |
(w)est ------ (e)ast
         |
      (s)outh
```

**New Layout:**
```
(h)elp  (l)ook  (i)nventory
(t)ake  (d)rop  e(x)amine
(u)se   (e)at   say

      (n)orth
         |
(w)est ------ (e)ast
         |
      (s)outh         HOME
```

**Implementation (textAdventure.js ~line 1556-1573):**
- Replaced "HOME" with "say" in command grid
- Moved "HOME" to bottom right corner next to (s)outh

**Files modified:**
- textAdventure.js - Updated commandsHTML and compassHTML

## Technical Architecture Updates

### SAY Command Processing
1. Extract phrase after "say" or "speak"
2. Normalize: remove spaces/dashes, convert to lowercase
3. Check current room for context-sensitive responses
4. Execute appropriate action or show "nothing happens"

### Safe Puzzle System
- hasBeenOpened flag prevents re-triggering
- Reveals items by setting location and visible properties
- Updates room state automatically with lookAtRoom()

### Secret Door Reveal System
- Door starts: visible: false, locked: true
- Password triggers: visible: true, locked: false, open: true
- Exit appears in room description after reveal

### Inventory Display System
- New inventoryDisplay property for formatted names
- Fallback to regular display if not defined
- HTML tags supported via innerHTML rendering
- Bold tags `<b>keyword</b>` work perfectly

## Known Issues & Future Enhancements

### Working Perfectly:
- ✅ SAY command with flexible input normalization
- ✅ Safe combination puzzle (13-97-55)
- ✅ Bookmark decorative display
- ✅ Password paper revelation
- ✅ Secret door password (say friend)
- ✅ Krugerrand appears in correct grid square (8)
- ✅ Bold keywords in inventory display
- ✅ Command grid with SAY and relocated HOME

### Not Yet Implemented:
- **Button in MUSIC-ROOM** to reveal secret door (door currently revealed by password)
- Two-step secret door: button → visible, password → unlocked
- Health system display (property exists but not shown)
- Image display during examine (icon150, icon90x90 ready but not shown)

### Immediate Next Steps:

**1. Add Button to MUSIC-ROOM:**
- Create button item (type: "fixed", location: "MUSIC-ROOM")
- USE BUTTON → sets music-room2game-room.visible = true
- Door appears but remains locked
- SAY FRIEND → unlocks door (visible check already in code)

**2. Separate Door Reveal and Unlock:**
Current: SAY FRIEND → visible + unlocked
Desired:
- Step 1: USE BUTTON → visible only
- Step 2: SAY FRIEND → unlocked only

**Implementation Plan:**
```javascript
// In handleUseCommand() - add button handler
if (itemKey === "button" && currentRoom === "MUSIC-ROOM") {
  const secretDoor = doors["music-room2game-room"];
  secretDoor.visible = true;
  addToBuffer([
    { text: "You press the button. A hidden panel slides away, revealing a door to the north! But it's locked.", type: "flavor" }
  ]);
  lookAtRoom();
}

// In handleSayCommand() - modify door check
if (currentRoom === "MUSIC-ROOM" && normalizedPhrase.includes("friend")) {
  const secretDoor = doors["music-room2game-room"];
  if (secretDoor.visible && secretDoor.locked) {
    // Unlock only (door already visible from button)
    secretDoor.locked = false;
    secretDoor.open = true;
    addToBuffer([...unlock messages...]);
  } else if (!secretDoor.visible) {
    addToBuffer([{ text: "You sense there might be a secret here, but you don't see a door.", type: "flavor" }]);
  }
}
```

### Future Enhancements:

**Additional Puzzles:**
- More combination locks (safes, doors)
- Riddles requiring SAY answers
- Password-protected areas
- Multi-step puzzle chains

**Visual Enhancements:**
- Show item images when examining (icon150, icon90x90)
- Overlay or inline image display
- Item icons in inventory list

**Health System:**
- Display health in status panel
- Track health changes from eating
- Health-based game mechanics
