## Current State - v0.19.2 Bug Fixes & Polish

**The Radley House** Halloween text adventure game continues with critical bug fixes and UI improvements. Game remains feature complete and ready for release after final playtesting.

### Git Status
**Branch:** main
**Last Commit:** d5f3db0 update safe combo description
**Status:** All changes committed and pushed ‚úÖ

### Recent Session Work (Oct 10-11, 2025 - Late Night)

#### Major Achievements: Bug Fixes & Safe Puzzle Enhancement ‚úÖ

**Complete Implementation (3 major fixes):**

1. ‚úÖ Fixed GitHub Pages image display issue (case sensitivity)
2. ‚úÖ Added safe examination requirement before SAY 666 works
3. ‚úÖ Updated safe examine text for clarity

---

## Fix 1: GitHub Pages Background Image Issue

**Problem:**
- START room background image (dark street) displayed locally but not on GitHub Pages
- Cause: Case sensitivity - Windows is case-insensitive, Linux (GitHub Pages) is case-sensitive

**File Name Issue:**
- Actual file: `DarkStreet250x250.png` (capital D and S)
- JSON reference: `darkstreet250x250.png` (all lowercase)

**Solution:** Updated rooms-w-doors.json to match actual filename case.

**Implementation:**
- **File:** `HALLOWEEN-GAME/rooms-w-doors.json` line 26
- **Change:** `"backgroundPic": "assets/background/darkstreet250x250.png"`
- **To:** `"backgroundPic": "assets/background/DarkStreet250x250.png"`

**Result:** Background image now displays correctly on GitHub Pages ‚úÖ

**Learning:** All other background images already used correct PascalCase (McGillicuttyHouse250x250.png, RadleyHouse250x250.png, HOME250x250.png)

## Fix 2: Safe Examination Requirement

**Problem:**
Players could use SAY 666 to open the safe as long as they had the bookmark, even if they never examined the safe itself. This bypassed the discovery process.

**Solution:**
Added examination requirement to safe (matching the stereo system and DVD cabinet pattern).

**Implementation:**

### 1. HALLOWEEN-GAME/items.json (line 177)
Added `hasBeenExamined` flag:
```json
"hasBeenOpened": false,
"hasBeenExamined": false,
"actions": {
```

### 2. textAdventure.js - EXAMINE handler (lines 2362-2365)
Set flag when safe is examined:
```javascript
// Mark safe as examined (needed for SAY 666 command)
if (itemKey === "safe") {
  item.hasBeenExamined = true;
}
```

### 3. textAdventure.js - SAY handler (lines 1659-1669)
Check flag before allowing combination:
```javascript
if (safe && !safe.hasBeenOpened && normalizedPhrase === "666") {
  // Check if player has examined the safe first
  if (!safe.hasBeenExamined) {
    addToBuffer([
      {
        text: "You should examine the safe first to see how it works.",
        type: "error",
      },
    ]);
    // Return without setting lastCommandSucceeded = true (no time penalty)
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of logic
}
```

**Flow Now:**
1. Player enters STUDY ‚Üí sees safe
2. Player must **EXAMINE SAFE** first ‚Üí learns about combination lock
3. Player must find **bookmark** in Frankenstein book
4. Player must **EXAMINE BOOKMARK** ‚Üí sees "666" clue
5. Player can successfully **SAY 666** ‚Üí opens safe
6. Failed attempts before examining safe have **no time penalty** ‚úÖ

**Pattern Consistency:**
This matches the existing patterns for:
- Stereo system (MUSIC-ROOM) - must examine before pressing buttons
- DVD cabinet (TV-ROOM) - must examine before opening
- Parchment paper - must examine before SAY FRIEND works

---

## Fix 3: Safe Combination Text Clarity

**Problem:**
Safe examine text said "dial shows numbers from 0 to 99" but combination is 666, which is inconsistent.

**User Request:**
Make it clearer that it's a three-number combination.

**Solution:**
Updated examine text to explicitly show the format.

**Implementation:**
- **File:** `HALLOWEEN-GAME/items.json` line 179
- **Old Text:** "An old cast iron safe, used for valuables. It has an old fashioned rotary combination lock next to the handle. The dial shows numbers from 0 to 99."
- **New Text:** "An old cast iron safe, used for valuables. It has an old fashioned rotary combination lock next to the handle. Dial requires three numbers: #-#-#"

**Result:**
Players now clearly understand they need to enter a three-digit combination in the format #-#-# (like 6-6-6).

## GitHub Pages Deployment Notes

**Browser Caching Issue:**
- Changes committed and pushed to GitHub successfully
- GitHub Pages typically deploys in 1-10 minutes
- **Important:** Users viewing the site won't see changes until they:
  - Do a hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
  - Close and reopen browser
  - Open in incognito/private window

**How It Works:**
- Each visitor's browser caches files independently
- One person viewing doesn't prevent updates for others
- Active viewers need to refresh to see changes
- JSON files can be cached aggressively by browsers
