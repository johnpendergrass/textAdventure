# Text Formatting and "Take" Message System Improvements

## Current State of Project

Today's session focused on improving player feedback and guidance through inline text formatting (bold, colors, font sizes) and implementing helpful "cannot take" messages for fixed items. This provides better visual cues for commands and more helpful error messages.

## Major Accomplishments Completed (October 5, 2025 - Afternoon Session)

### ✅ Inline Text Formatting System

**Problem solved:** Players needed visual hints about which words to type (commands, directions, item names).

**HTML Formatting in JSON:**
All text that goes through `innerHTML` can use HTML tags:
- `<b>word</b>` - Bold text
- `<span style='color: #ffcc00;'>text</span>` - Colored text
- `<span style='font-size: 24px;'>text</span>` - Sized text
- `<br><br>` - Blank lines in regular text
- `\n\n` - Blank lines in notes items

**Important:** Use single quotes in style attributes to avoid JSON escaping issues.

**Files modified:**
- rooms-w-doors.json - Added bold to directions and commands in hints
- items.json - Added bold to item names throughout

### ✅ Bold Formatting in rooms-w-doors.json (8 edits)

**Rooms updated with bold directions and hints:**

1. **STREET-01** (line 18) - Bolded directions in repeat text
2. **STREET-02** (line 34) - Fixed direction bug (south→west), added bold
3. **NICE-HOUSE** (line 66) - Yellow hint with bold commands
4. **FOYER** (line 100) - Yellow hint about taking items
5. **LIBRARY** (line 119) - Yellow hint about examining
6. **STUDY** (line 154) - Yellow hint about examining
7. **MUSIC-ROOM** (line 171) - Yellow hint about looking
8. **TV-ROOM** (line 236) - Bolded "cabinet", added open hint
9. **FRONT-PORCH** (line 84,87) - Bolded knocker hint and directions in lookText
10. **NICE-PORCH** (line 50) - Added bold to doorbell hint

**Hint format:**
```html
<span style='color: #ffcc00;'>[hint: type <b>examine list</b> to read the list.]</span>
```

**Files modified:**
- rooms-w-doors.json - Multiple enterText, lookText updates

### ✅ Bold Formatting in items.json Display Fields (29 edits)

**Problem solved:** Item names in room listings and inventory needed to stand out.

**Fixed/tool items (6 items):**
- candy_bag: "candy <b>bag</b>"
- powerfulpc: "powerful <b>PC</b>"
- dvdcabinet: "DVD <b>cabinet</b>"
- brass_key: "brass <b>key</b>"
- oldnote: "old <b>bookmark</b>"
- passwordpaper: "<b>parchment</b> paper"

**Candy items (23 items):**
All candy items updated with bold on main typeable word:
- Brand names fully bolded: "<b>Snickers</b> mini-bar", "<b>Butterfinger</b> bar", etc.
- Generic items with key word: "Red <b>apple</b>", "Dirty <b>socks</b>"

**Files modified:**
- items.json - Updated all 29 display fields

### ✅ Bold Formatting in Action Responses (47+ edits)

**Problem solved:** Item names in examine/take/eat responses should be consistent.

**Pattern:**
- examine: "A brass <b>doorbell</b> button..."
- take: "You pick up the <b>Snickers</b> bar..."
- eat: Various responses (some mention item, some don't)

**All items updated:**
- doorbell, porch lights, door knocker, safe, musicsystem, powerfulpc, dvdcabinet
- brass_key, oldnote, mrsmcgillicuttyslist, passwordpaper
- All 23 candy items
- socks

**Files modified:**
- items.json - Bolded item names in all action responses

### ✅ Dramatic Text Effects

**Door knocker response:**
```json
"<span style='font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold; color: #ff0000; text-shadow: 0 0 10px red;'>KNOCK! KNOCK!</span> <span style='font-size: 48px; font-weight: bold; color: #8B00FF; text-shadow: 0 0 10px red;'>GONG!</span>"
```

**Doorbell response:**
```json
"<span style='font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; color: #00BFFF; text-shadow: 0 0 10px #00BFFF, 0 0 20px #87CEEB, 0 0 30px #FFFFFF, 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);'>Ding Dong!</span>"
```

**Color recommendations provided:**
- Purple: #9370DB (Medium Purple) - best balance
- Purple glow: #8B00FF (Electric Violet) - used in door knocker GONG

**Files modified:**
- items.json - door_knocker and doorbell responses

### ✅ "Take" Action Messages for Fixed Items (8 items)

**Problem solved:** Players got confusing error "You don't see any X here" when trying to take fixed items.

**Items with custom "take" messages:**
1. **doorbell** - "You cannot take it. It's attached to the house. But you could <b>ring</b> it or <b>use</b> it."
2. **porch_light_nice** - "You cannot take it. It's part of the house. But you could <b>examine</b> it."
3. **door_knocker** - "You cannot take it. It's attached to the door. But you could <b>use</b> it or <b>knock</b> with it."
4. **porch_light_front** - "You cannot take it. It's part of the house. But you could <b>examine</b> it."
5. **safe** - "It's too heavy to move. But you could <b>examine</b> it."
6. **musicsystem** - "It's mounted on the wall. You cannot take it. But you could <b>examine</b> it."
7. **powerfulpc** - "It's too heavy and bulky to carry. But you could <b>examine</b> it."
8. **dvdcabinet** - "It's a piece of furniture. You cannot take it. But you could <b>examine</b> it or <b>open</b> it."

**Format change - from string to object:**
```json
"take": {
  "response": "You cannot take it. It's attached to the house...",
  "addToInventory": false
}
```

**Files modified:**
- items.json - Added take actions to 8 fixed items

### ✅ Fixed Item "droppable" Property Corrections (4 items)

**Problem solved:** Some fixed items had `"droppable": true` but shouldn't be takeable.

**Changed from true to false:**
- doorbell (line 44)
- porch_light_nice (line 77)
- door_knocker (line 101)
- porch_light_front (line 131)

**Files modified:**
- items.json - Fixed droppable properties

### ✅ Modified handleTakeCommand() in textAdventure.js

**Problem solved:** Take command only recognized items with `addToInventory === true`.

**Key changes (lines 875-924):**

**Old filter logic (line 883):**
```javascript
item.actions?.take?.addToInventory === true
```

**New filter logic:**
```javascript
item.actions?.take !== undefined
```

**New conditional (line 909):**
```javascript
// Only move to inventory if addToInventory is true
if (takeAction.addToInventory === true) {
  item.location = "INVENTORY";
  // ... update status, scavenger grid
}
```

**How it works now:**
- Items with `addToInventory: true` → show response, move to inventory
- Items with `addToInventory: false` → show response only (custom "cannot take" message)
- Items without take action → show error

**Files modified:**
- textAdventure.js - Lines 875-924

### ✅ Modified handleExamineCommand() in textAdventure.js

**Problem solved:** Examine command thought fixed items with "take" actions needed to be in inventory.

**Key change (line 1337):**

**Old logic:**
```javascript
if (item.actions.take) {
```

**New logic:**
```javascript
if (item.actions.take && item.actions.take.addToInventory === true) {
```

**How it works now:**
- Items with `addToInventory: true` → must be in inventory to examine
- Items with `addToInventory: false` → can examine in room (fall through to else block)
- Items without take action → can examine in room

**Files modified:**
- textAdventure.js - Line 1337

### ✅ Added Common typedNames to Porch Lights (2 items)

**Problem solved:** Players typing "get porch light" got error because porch lights only had specific typedNames.

**porch_light_nice (lines 68-76):**
Added: "porchlight", "light", "porch"

**porch_light_front (lines 131-139):**
Added: "porchlight", "light", "porch"

**Safe because of location filtering:**
- porch_light_nice is in NICE-PORCH
- porch_light_front is in FRONT-PORCH
- Commands only find items in current room
- No confusion possible

**Files modified:**
- items.json - Added common typedNames to both porch lights

## Current Game Statistics

### Items (46 total)
- **Tools**: 1 item (brass_key)
- **Notes**: 3 items (oldnote/bookmark, mrsmcgillicuttyslist, passwordpaper)
- **Scavenger**: 11 items (9 active, 2 inactive)
- **Candy**: 23 items (all active, eatable)
- **Fixed**: 8 items (doorbell, door_knocker, 2 porch lights, candy_bag-inactive, safe, musicsystem, powerfulpc, dvdcabinet)
  - All 8 now have custom "take" messages ✨

### Commands (14 total)
- help (h, ?)
- look (l)
- inventory (i)
- north (n), south (s), east (e), west (w)
- take (get, grab, pick) ✨ IMPROVED
- examine (x, ex) ✨ IMPROVED
- drop (put, place)
- use (u, ring)
- eat
- say (speak)
- open (unlock)
- quit (home)

### Visual Formatting
- **Bold**: Directions, commands, item names
- **Colors**: #ffcc00 (yellow) for hints, #00BFFF (blue) for doorbell, #ff0000 (red) for knocker, #8B00FF (purple) for gong
- **Font sizes**: 24px (doorbell), 28px (knock), 48px (gong)
- **Text shadows**: Glowing effects on doorbell and knocker

## Technical Architecture Updates

### Take Command Flow (textAdventure.js handleTakeCommand)
1. Parse "take [item]" command
2. Find item in current room with matching typedName
3. Check if item has actions.take (undefined check)
4. Show takeAction.response message
5. **If addToInventory === true:** Move to inventory, update status, update scavenger grid
6. **If addToInventory === false:** Just show message, item stays in place

### Examine Command Flow (textAdventure.js handleExamineCommand)
1. Parse "examine [item]" command
2. Find item anywhere (room or inventory) with matching typedName
3. Check if item has actions.examine
4. **If take.addToInventory === true:** Require item in inventory
5. **If take.addToInventory === false OR no take action:** Allow examining in room
6. Show examine text (type: "notes" for notes items, "flavor" for others)
7. Handle revealsItem logic if applicable

### Text Rendering Pipeline
1. JSON/JS text → addToBuffer()
2. textBuffer → updateDisplay()
3. innerHTML → DOM
4. HTML tags render (bold, colors, sizes, shadows)

**Important:** All text goes through innerHTML, so HTML works in both JSON and JS strings.

- ✅ Yellow hints render correctly
- ✅ Doorbell "Ding Dong!" shows blue sparkle effect
- ✅ Door knocker shows red KNOCK and purple GONG
- ✅ Item names bold in room listings
- ✅ Item names bold in inventory
- ✅ Item names bold in examine responses

**Take Command:**
- ✅ "take doorbell" → Shows "cannot take" message
- ✅ "take porch light" → Shows "cannot take" message
- ✅ "take knocker" → Shows "cannot take" message
- ✅ "take safe" → Shows "cannot take" message
- ✅ "take stereo" → Shows "cannot take" message

- ✅ "examine doorbell" → Shows examine text (fixed items work)
- ✅ "examine safe" → Shows examine text (fixed items work)
- ✅ "examine list" → Requires in inventory (notes items work)
- ✅ "examine snickers" → Requires in inventory (candy items work)

**Porch Light Names:**
- ✅ "examine porch light" → Works
- ✅ "examine light" → Works
- ✅ "examine porch" → Works
- ✅ "take porchlight" → Shows cannot take message

### JSON Validation:
- ✅ items.json - Valid JSON
- ✅ rooms-w-doors.json - Valid JSON

## Known Issues & Design Decisions

### Design Decisions Made:

**Why addToInventory property?**
- Allows single "take" action system for both takeable and non-takeable items
- More flexible than separate item types
- Enables custom messages for fixed items
- Maintains backward compatibility (existing items with addToInventory: true work unchanged)

**Why bold only main word in display?**
- Red <b>apple</b> not <b>Red apple</b>
- Makes the typeable word stand out
- Cleaner visual appearance
- Based on typedNames list priorities

**Why same typedNames for both porch lights?**
- Safe because items are in different rooms
- Commands filter by currentRoom
- No collision possible
- Natural language ("light", "porch") works everywhere

**Why single quotes in HTML style attributes?**
- JSON uses double quotes for strings
- Escaping inner double quotes is error-prone
- Single quotes in HTML attributes work perfectly
- Example: `style='color: #ffcc00;'` not `style=\"color: #ffcc00;\"`

### Working Perfectly:
- ✅ Inline text formatting (bold, colors, sizes)
- ✅ Custom "cannot take" messages on all fixed items
- ✅ Take command with addToInventory logic
- ✅ Examine command with addToInventory logic
- ✅ Porch light common typedNames
- ✅ Dramatic doorbell and knocker effects
- ✅ JSON validation after all changes

### Not Issues (Previously Thought):
- ~~Porch lights don't respond to "get light"~~ - FIXED
- ~~Examine requires pickup for fixed items~~ - FIXED
- ~~No feedback when trying to take fixed items~~ - FIXED
- ~~Item names not visually distinct~~ - FIXED

## Context for Next Claude Code Session

**TEXT FORMATTING SYSTEM COMPLETE**: All room descriptions, hints, and item text now use HTML formatting for bold, colors, and sizes. Yellow hints guide players on what to type.

**"TAKE" MESSAGE SYSTEM COMPLETE**: All 8 fixed items now have helpful custom messages explaining why they can't be taken and suggesting alternative actions.

**TAKE/EXAMINE COMMANDS IMPROVED**: Both commands now properly handle `addToInventory: false` items, allowing fixed items to have "take" actions that show messages without moving the item.

**VISUAL POLISH COMPLETE**: Dramatic effects on doorbell (blue sparkle) and door knocker (red KNOCK, purple GONG) add personality to the game.

**IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:**
1. Consider adding more dramatic effects to other items/actions
2. Could add colored text to other game messages (errors, success, etc.)
3. Could add more visual hints in room descriptions
4. Consider adding item icons/images during examine (infrastructure ready)

**Key architectural achievements:**
- Unified take action system supporting both takeable and non-takeable items
- HTML formatting pipeline working consistently across JSON and JS
- Custom error messages providing helpful guidance
- Visual hierarchy through bold, colors, and sizes
- Flexible text formatting that doesn't break JSON

**Current version**: v0.31 - Text Formatting and Take Message Improvements

**Total items**: 46 (all with bold formatting in display fields)
**Fixed items with take messages**: 8/8 (100%)
**Rooms with formatting**: 10+ rooms updated
**Commands improved**: take, examine

The game now provides much better visual feedback and guidance to players through consistent formatting and helpful error messages!
