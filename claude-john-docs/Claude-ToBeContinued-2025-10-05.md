# Three New Puzzle Systems: Music System, Powerful PC, and DVD Cabinet

## Current State of Project

Today's session focused on implementing three interconnected puzzle systems using the SAY and new OPEN commands. We added a music system in MUSIC-ROOM that reveals the secret door, a powerful gaming PC in GAME-ROOM with a removable video card, and a DVD cabinet puzzle in TV-ROOM featuring a humorous paradox.

## Major Accomplishments Completed (October 5, 2025)

### ✅ Music System Sound Options Puzzle

**Problem solved:** Secret door needed a two-step reveal - first make it visible, then unlock it with password.

**Music System Item (items.json):**
```json
"musicsystem": {
  "type": "fixed",
  "location": "MUSIC-ROOM",
  "examine": "A top-of-the-line music system sits on a shelf mounted on the north wall. The brushed aluminum faceplate gleams in the dim light. On the front panel, you notice a selector labeled 'Sound Options' with three buttons: 'music', 'movie', and 'game'."
}
```

**SAY Command Integration (textAdventure.js ~line 1065-1142):**
- **SAY MUSIC** → "Music mode selected - warm equalization active."
- **SAY MOVIE** or **SAY THEATER** → "Movie mode selected - surround sound optimized."
- **SAY GAME** or **SAY GAMING** → "Gaming mode selected - bass boost active." + mechanical CLICK + **door becomes visible**
- **SAY FRIEND** (when door visible) → Door unlocks with rumbling THUNK

**Secret Door Two-Step Process:**
1. Examine music system → learn about sound options
2. SAY GAME → door becomes visible (north exit appears) but remains locked
3. SAY FRIEND → door unlocks (from password paper in safe)
4. GO NORTH → enter GAME-ROOM

**Files modified:**
- items.json - Added musicsystem item
- textAdventure.js - Enhanced handleSayCommand() with music system logic
- textAdventure.js - Modified secret door password to check visibility first

### ✅ Powerful PC with Removable Video Card

**Problem solved:** NVidia 5090 scavenger item needed to be hidden inside PC, revealed by examination (not OPEN).

**Powerful PC Item (items.json):**
```json
"powerfulpc": {
  "type": "fixed",
  "location": "GAME-ROOM",
  "revealsItem": "nvidia",
  "hasBeenSearched": false,
  "examine": "A beast of a gaming machine! The specs are impressive: Intel Core 9 Ultra 19900000K CPU, 2.3TB DDR7 RAM, 32GB Seagate Barracuda hard drive, and an NVidia 5090 Video Card. Wait... you notice the video card isn't fully seated in its slot. It looks like you could remove it if you wanted. 'Shame to butcher such a nice PC for parts,' you think."
}
```

**Humorous Specs:**
- Intel Core 9 Ultra 19900000K CPU
- 2.3TB DDR7 RAM
- 32GB Seagate Barracuda HD (intentionally tiny!)
- NVidia 5090 Video Card (removable)

**NVidia 5090 Update (scavengerItems.json):**
- Changed location from GAME-ROOM → HIDDEN
- Changed visible from true → false
- Added originalLocation: "GAME-ROOM" (for grid display in square 0)

**Reveal Logic (textAdventure.js ~line 1329):**
- Fixed items without "open" action auto-reveal on EXAMINE
- PC reveals NVidia card in current room (not inventory)
- Player must pick up card separately

**Player Experience:**
1. Enter GAME-ROOM → see powerful PC
2. EXAMINE PC → see humorous specs, card appears in room
3. GET 5090 → pick up as scavenger item

**Files modified:**
- items.json - Added powerfulpc item
- scavengerItems.json - Hid nvidia initially, added originalLocation
- textAdventure.js - Added reveal logic for fixed items (~line 1250-1264)

### ✅ DVD Cabinet Puzzle with Movie Paradox

**Problem solved:** Create engaging puzzle where DVD is visible but inaccessible until cabinet is opened.

**TV-ROOM Description Update (rooms-w-doors.json):**
```
First visit: "You enter the TV room. A large flat-screen TV mounted on the wall is playing a movie - the classic 1938 screwball comedy 'Bringing Up Baby.' On the screen, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn are in the middle of a hilarious scene involving a leopard. Against the opposite wall stands an elegant wooden cabinet with glass doors. Through the glass, you can see shelves lined with DVD cases. Your eyes are drawn to a DVD of 'Bringing Up Baby' on the second shelf. Wait... how is the movie playing if the DVD is right there in the cabinet?"
```

**The Paradox:** Movie is playing on TV, but DVD is visible in locked cabinet!

**DVD Cabinet Item (items.json):**
```json
"dvdcabinet": {
  "type": "fixed",
  "location": "TV-ROOM",
  "hasBeenOpened": false,
  "revealsItem": "bringingupbaby",
  "actions": {
    "examine": "A handsome wooden cabinet with glass doors. Through the glass you can see shelves lined with DVD cases - classics, comedies, thrillers. You spot 'Bringing Up Baby' on the second shelf.",
    "open": "You pull open the glass doors. The DVDs are now accessible."
  }
}
```

**Bringing Up Baby Update (scavengerItems.json):**
- Changed location from TV-ROOM → HIDDEN
- Changed visible from true → false
- Added originalLocation: "TV-ROOM" (for grid square 5)

**Player Experience:**
1. Enter TV-ROOM → see movie playing, notice DVD paradox
2. EXAMINE CABINET → see DVD through glass, cannot take it
3. OPEN CABINET → glass doors open, DVD appears in room
4. GET BRINGINGUPBABY → pick up DVD as scavenger item

**Files modified:**
- rooms-w-doors.json - Updated TV-ROOM description with movie and paradox
- items.json - Added dvdcabinet item
- scavengerItems.json - Hid bringingupbaby initially

### ✅ OPEN Command Implementation

**Problem solved:** Need command to open containers, cabinets, doors.

**Command Definition (commands.json):**
```json
"open": {
  "includeInGame": true,
  "type": "action",
  "shortcuts": ["unlock"],
  "action": "open_item"
}
```

**handleOpenCommand() Function (textAdventure.js ~line 1151-1226):**
- Extracts item name from "open [item]"
- Finds item in room or inventory by typedNames
- Validates item has actions.open
- Special handling for dvdcabinet:
  - First open: reveals DVD, marks hasBeenOpened, shows success
  - Already opened: "The cabinet is already open."
- Generic handler for future openable items

**Player commands:**
- OPEN CABINET
- OPEN DVDCABINET
- OPEN CASE
- UNLOCK CABINET (shortcut)

**Files modified:**
- commands.json - Added open command
- textAdventure.js - Added handleOpenCommand() function
- textAdventure.js - Added open_item case to processCommand()

### ✅ Fixed Examine/Open Reveal Logic

**Problem solved:** DVD cabinet was revealing DVD on EXAMINE instead of OPEN.

**Root Cause:** Fixed item examine logic auto-triggered reveal for ALL items with revealsItem property.

**Fix (textAdventure.js ~line 1329):**
```javascript
// Skip auto-reveal for items with open action (they reveal on OPEN instead)
if (item.revealsItem && !item.hasBeenSearched && !item.actions?.open) {
```

**Logic:**
- Items WITH open action → reveal ONLY on OPEN command
- Items WITHOUT open action → reveal on EXAMINE

**Results:**
- DVD cabinet → reveals on OPEN ✓
- Powerful PC → reveals on EXAMINE ✓
- Frankenstein book → reveals on EXAMINE ✓
- Safe → reveals on SAY combination ✓

**Files modified:**
- textAdventure.js - Added condition to prevent auto-reveal for openable items

## Technical Architecture Updates

### SAY Command - Music System Integration
1. Check current room (MUSIC-ROOM)
2. Normalize phrase (remove spaces, lowercase)
3. Check for sound options: music, movie/theater, game/gaming
4. Execute appropriate response
5. For "game" → reveal secret door (set visible: true)
6. For "friend" → check door visible, then unlock if locked

### OPEN Command System
1. Extract item name from "open [item]"
2. Strip spaces from item name for matching
3. Find item by typedNames in room or inventory
4. Validate item has actions.open
5. Execute special logic (dvdcabinet) or generic response
6. If revealsItem property exists → reveal item in room
7. Update game status and show room

### Reveal System Logic
**Two reveal methods:**

**Method 1: Auto-reveal on EXAMINE (for items without open action)**
- Frankenstein book → reveals bookmark
- Powerful PC → reveals NVidia 5090
- Condition: `revealsItem && !hasBeenSearched && !actions.open`

**Method 2: Manual reveal on OPEN (for items with open action)**
- DVD cabinet → reveals Bringing Up Baby DVD
- Condition: Item has actions.open, checked in handleOpenCommand()

**Method 3: Manual reveal on SAY (for special puzzles)**
- Safe → reveals krugerrand and password paper
- Music system → reveals secret door visibility
- Handled in handleSayCommand()

### Item Reveal Destinations
- **Portable items (has take action)**: Revealed to INVENTORY
  - Example: Bookmark from Frankenstein book
- **Fixed items (no take action)**: Revealed to currentRoom
  - Example: NVidia 5090 from PC, DVD from cabinet
