## Work Completed This Session

### 1. Curfew Display System Overhaul ‚≠ê

**Problem:** Curfew time display was static and didn't indicate urgency when player was late.

**Solution:** Three-tier urgency system with color changes and animations.

#### Color Changes (theRadleyHouse.css)
- **Default (on time):** White text, white border (matches status box)
- **Late (after 8:30 PM):** Medium bright red (#ff5555) text and border
- **Very late (>10 min):** Red + slow flash (1.5s cycle)
- **Super late (>15 min):** Red + fast urgent flash (0.6s cycle)

#### Bug Fix (theRadleyHouse.js:887)
**Problem:** Curfew box color didn't change when time advanced.

**Solution:** Changed `updateGameTime()` to call `updateGameStatus()` instead of just `updateClockDisplay()`. This regenerates the entire status panel with correct class assignments.

**Code location:** `theRadleyHouse.js` line 887
```javascript
updateGameStatus(); // Was: updateClockDisplay();
```

#### Animation System (theRadleyHouse.css)
**New keyframe animation:**
```css
@keyframes curfewFlash {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
  50% { opacity: 0.4; }
}
```

**Applied selectively:**
- `.time-box.curfew-very-late .time-value` - 1.5s cycle
- `.time-box.curfew-super-late .time-value` - 0.6s cycle (overrides slower)

**Only the time value flashes** - box and label stay solid red.

### 2. Universal Auto-LOOK System ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Problem:** Players felt "left hanging" after most commands - didn't know what to do next.

**Solution:** Added automatic room description display (LOOK) after every typed command.

#### Commands Enhanced (9 total)

**EAT command** (theRadleyHouse.js:1717-1719)
- Added blank line + `lookAtRoom()` after eating candy

**INVENTORY command** (theRadleyHouse.js:966-968, 1055-1057)
- Added to both empty inventory and after displaying items

**DROP command** (theRadleyHouse.js:1321-1323)
- Added after successfully dropping item

**HELP command** (theRadleyHouse.js:860-861)
- Added after showing help text

**SAY command** (theRadleyHouse.js - 5 branches)
- Music mode: 1870-1872
- Movie mode: 1889-1891
- Gaming mode already active: 1929-1931
- Friend password (door not visible): 1993-1995
- Friend password (door already unlocked): 2003-2005
- **Note:** Branches that already had lookAtRoom() were left unchanged

**USE command** (theRadleyHouse.js - 5 branches)
- Doorbell subsequent uses: 2581-2583
- Door knocker already unlocked: 2615-2617
- Brass key already used: 2642-2644
- Safe (both locked and unlocked): 2686-2688
- Generic use: 2695-2697
- **Note:** Branches that already had lookAtRoom() were left unchanged

#### Pattern Used
```javascript
// Show room description after [command]
addToBuffer([{ text: "", type: "flavor" }]); // Blank line
lookAtRoom();
```

**Result:** Players ALWAYS see where they are, what items are available, and which exits exist after ANY command.

---

### 3. Bookmark DROP Bug Fix üêõ

**Problem:** Player could see bookmark in inventory but got error "You're not carrying any bookmark" when trying to DROP it.

**Root Cause:** The bookmark (oldnote) item was missing a `take` action in items.json. The DROP command filters inventory items by checking for `item.actions?.take`, so items without this action couldn't be dropped even though they were in inventory.

**Solution:** Added `take` action to oldnote item definition.

**File:** `HALLOWEEN-GAME/items.json` lines 343-346
```json
"actions": {
  "examine": "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/| number of the beast |\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/\\/|\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------",
  "take": {
    "response": "You carefully take the old <b>bookmark</b>.",
    "addToInventory": true
  }
}
```

**Result:** Now when player tries to DROP bookmark, it properly shows: "You worked hard to find this treasure! You cannot drop it." (because `droppable: false`)
