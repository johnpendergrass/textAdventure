## Current State - v0.35

**The Radley House** Halloween text adventure game is fully functional with recent improvements to UI/UX and scavenger item display.

### Recent Session Work (Oct 9, 2025)

#### Major Changes:

1. **Empty Enter Key Handler**
   - Added helpful hint when player presses Enter with no command
   - Shows: "I'll remind you of where you are now - but... btw... you can always use the scroll bar to scroll back in your game to see what happened earlier!"
   - Auto-executes LOOK command
   - Anti-spam protection: only shows once, then silent on repeated empty Enter presses

2. **Command Shortcuts Cleanup**
   - Removed invalid hardcoded shortcuts from help displays
   - Fixed: take, examine, drop shortcuts to match commands.json
   - Updated CONFIG_FALLBACKS to match actual command definitions

3. **FOYER Room Enhancement**
   - Added staggered "cautiously" text effect on first entry
   - Creates visual emphasis as player enters the house

4. **Gong Handle Fix**
   - Updated all references from "Door gong handle" to "gong handle"
   - Added "gonghandle" as valid typed name
   - Fixed JSON syntax error that was breaking items.json

   - All new image assets in place (monsterMashCD, strangerThings)

7. **TV ROOM Updates**
   - Changed from "Bringing Up Baby" movie to "Stranger Things" show
   - New description: "kids on bikes racing through dark forest, flashlights cutting through fog"

8. **DEBUG Command Improvements**
   - Now checks if all 9 scavenger items collected after adding items
   - Triggers celebration if player already had pumpkin
   - Conditional messaging: shows "You now have all 9 scavenger items! Celebration incoming..." or "You still need to find the pumpkin - check the FOYER."

9. **CELEBRATE Command Fix**
   - Changed error message to: "You have not won yet! You must collect all nine scaventer items to win."

10. **Scavenger Item Display Redesign**
    - **NEW**: Scavenger hunt announcement now displays to the RIGHT of item image
    - Vertical stacked badge format:
      ```
      *********
      SCAVENGER
        HUNT
         ITEM
      *********
         one
         of
        nine
      ```
    - Uses flexbox layout: 250px image + stacked text badge
    - All text uses flashing `scavenger-found` animation
    - Added automatic LOOK command after taking scavenger items
    - Shows room description, items, and exits after pickup

11. **CSS Animation Addition**

## Notes for Next Session

- The scavenger item display redesign is working well with the side-by-side layout
- Text area width is 607px (577px usable with padding), so 250px image + gap + text fits perfectly
- Consider if legal disclaimer placement change is needed or if current location is acceptable
- Game is feature-complete for Halloween 2025, focus shifting to polish and scoring
