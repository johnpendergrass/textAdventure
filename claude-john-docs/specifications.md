## v0.19.1 New Features

### Cheerful Doorbell Color üÜï
**Problem:** Doorbell "Ding Dong!" used light blue (#00BFFF) - not welcoming enough for friendly Mrs. McGillicutty.

- Location: `items.json` line 57 (doorbell use action)
- Creates warm, cheerful, welcoming appearance

### Context-Aware FOYER Hints üÜï
**Problem:** Static hint about picking up items wasn't helpful for players without the scavenger list.
**Solution:** Two different hints based on list status.

**With List (examined):**
```
[hint: type take <item> or get <item> to pick up items you find.]
```

**Without List (or not examined):**
```
[Hint: You will need to obtain and examine the scavenger hunt list from Mrs. McGillicutty to find the items!]

- Location: `commands.json` line 77
- Now consistent with help, look, inventory, score, etc.

### DVD Cabinet Examination Requirement üÜï

## Current Scoring System ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Status: COUNTS ONLY - No Point Calculation

**The game displays "SCORE" but only shows item COUNTS, not actual points.**

#### What Exists:
- All items have a `points` property defined in JSON
- `player.score` variable initialized in gameData.json
- UI panel titled "SCORE"

#### What's Missing:
- ‚ùå No score calculation when items collected
- ‚ùå No score update in handleTakeCommand()
- ‚ùå No final score display on HOME/QUIT screen
- ‚ùå Status panel shows counts instead of points

### Current vs. Desired Display

**Current (v0.37):**
```
SCORE
Scavenger Items: 3 / 9
Treats:          5 / 20
```

**Desired:**
```
SCORE: 35 / 108
Scavenger Items: 3 / 9 (30 pts)
Treats:          5 / 20 (5 pts)
```

### Point Values Defined (But Not Used)

**Scavenger Items:** 10 points each
- Total possible: 90 points (9 items)

**Candy/Treats:** 1 point each
- Total possible: ~18 points (~18 items)

**Maximum Score:** ~108 points

### Code Locations for Implementation

1. **Score Update:** theRadleyHouse.js:1076-1083 (handleTakeCommand)
   - Add: `player.score += (item.points || 0);`

2. **Display Update:** theRadleyHouse.js:2548-2553 (updateGameStatus)
   - Show actual score instead of just counts

3. **Final Score:** HOME/QUIT screen
   - Add score breakdown and grade/ranking

### Planned Enhancements

**Bonus Points:**
- All 9 scavenger items: +10 bonus
- Collect 20 treats: +5 bonus
- Perfect game bonuses

**Scoring Tiers:**
- 100-108: A+ (Perfect!)
- 90-99: A (Excellent!)
- 80-89: B (Very Good!)
- 70-79: C (Good!)
- 60-69: D (Acceptable)
- 0-59: F (Try Again!)

**Next Major Task:** Implement full scoring system with point calculation and display.

## Safe Puzzle System üÜï v0.36

### Requirements to Open Safe
1. Player must be in STUDY room
2. Player must have **bookmark** in inventory (revealed by examining Frankenstein book)
3. Player must have **examined the bookmark** (shows "number of the beast")
4. Player must enter correct combination: **SAY 6-6-6**

### Puzzle Flow
1. Find **Frankenstein book** in LIBRARY
2. **EXAMINE BOOK** ‚Üí reveals bookmark (auto-added to inventory)
3. **EXAMINE BOOKMARK** ‚Üí see "number of the beast"
4. Recognize that "number of the beast" = 666
5. Go to STUDY
6. **SAY 6-6-6** (or SAY 666)
7. Safe opens, reveals Indian Head pennies + parchment

### Error Messages

- With bookmark but not examined: "The safe will not open until you find the clue about the combination."

### Technical Implementation
