## Recent Work Completed (This Session)

### 1. **Scavenger Item Discovery Celebrations** âœ¨
- Added congratulatory message when picking up scavenger items
- Message format: `** SCAVENGER HUNT ITEM!!! ** (one of nine)`
- Bright orange flashing text with 2-second animation
- Word-based count ("one of nine" instead of "1 / 9")
- Only appears on first discovery, not in subsequent inventory views
- Beatles CD shortened to "Beatles Revolver CD" for better layout

### 2. **9th Item Victory Celebration Animation** ðŸŽ‰
- Massive visual celebration when collecting final scavenger item
- **3-second delay** before animation starts
- **Image grid display:**
  - 3Ã—3 grid of all 9 scavenger items (165Ã—165px each)
  - Items punch in with 360Â° rotation and scale animation
  - Staggered timing (0.15s delay between each)
  - Glowing orange/gold aura with pulsing effect
  - Fixed positioning overlay over text area
- **Victory text overlay** (appears 5 seconds after grid):
  - "YOU WON!"
  - "You found all NINE"
  - "SCAVENGER ITEMS!"
  - "Arthur and Mr. Radley"
  - "CONGRATULATE YOU!!"
  - Gold text (48px/28px) with chiseled text-shadow
  - Black semi-transparent background
  - Fade-in animation with scale effect
- Player dismisses with Enter key
- Smooth fade-out transition

### 3. **Two-Column Inventory Display**
- Scavenger items now display in 2 columns instead of 1
- Column width: 33 characters with &nbsp; padding
- HTML tag-aware length calculation
- Reduces vertical space by ~4 lines
- Applied to both INVENTORY command and HOME screen
- Prevents text overflow on HOME/QUIT screen

### 4. **Enhanced DEBUG Command**
- Now adds 8 scavenger items (all except pumpkin)
- Also adds 15 random candy/treats
- Marks all items as found
- Perfect for testing end-game scenarios
- Message: "DEBUG: Added 8 scavenger items and 15 treats to inventory"

### 5. **CELEBRATE Command**
- Hidden command to replay victory animation
- Only works if player has all 9 items
- Error message if incomplete: "You haven't collected all the scavenger items yet! Found: X / 9"
- Great for showing off the ending

### 6. **HINT Command** (New System)
- Displays all hidden/secret commands:
  - ABOUT - Game information
  - DEBUG - Testing items
  - CELEBRATE - Replay victory
  - RESTART - Reload game
  - THROW - Easter egg
  - HINT [secrets] - Shows list
- **Command Aliases section** in 2-column format:
  - Left column: north, south, east, west, help
  - Right column: look, examine, take, drop, inventory
  - Then: use, eat, open, say, quit
  - Compact display with proper &nbsp; spacing
- Shortcut: SECRETS also works

### 7. **RESTART Command**
- Simple `location.reload()` to restart game
- Listed in HINT
- Also has header hint

### 8. **ABOUT Command**
- Configurable text stored in gameData.json
- Shows game information/credits
- Editable without touching code
- Current content:
  - "About The Radley House"
  - Game description
  - Credits: "Game created by Poppy/John"
  - Version number

### 9. **Header Redesign** ðŸŽƒ
- **Title:** "The Radley House"
- **Subtitle:** "A well-articulated treasure hunt" (witty, hints at text-based gameplay)
- **Styling:**
  - Cinzel font (elegant serif) with 4px letter-spacing
  - Bright orange (#ff9500) with purple glow
  - 40px bold title
  - Pale purple (#b19cd9) italic subtitle
  - Halloween color scheme (orange/purple/black)
- **Header hints:**
  - Bottom-left: "Type **RESTART** to start a new game"
  - Bottom-right: "Type HINT for secrets"

### 10. **HOME Screen Improvements**
- Fixed text: "This was your final haul!:" moved to intro text
- Better flow and readability
- Two-column scavenger display
- Compact layout prevents overflow

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Celebration Animation Architecture
- Fixed positioning overlay (`position: fixed`)
- Calculates text div position with `getBoundingClientRect()`
- Appends to body (not text div) to avoid overflow issues
- CSS animations: `punchRotate` (0.6s) + `glowPulse` (2s infinite)
- Text overlay uses absolute positioning within grid
- Flag `awaitingCelebrationDismiss` blocks input until dismissed
- Auto-scrolls on image load for scavenger items

### Two-Column Helper Function
```javascript
formatScavengerTwoColumns(scavengerItems)
```
- Splits items into two halves (ceil for odd numbers)
- Uses `&nbsp;` HTML entities for proper spacing
- Strips HTML tags when calculating display length
- Pads to column width (33 chars) then appends second column

### Game Data Storage
- `gameData.about.text[]` - Configurable ABOUT content
- Easy to edit without code changes
- Follows same format as startup.welcomeText

---

## Current File Structure

### Core Files (8)
- textAdventure.html
- textAdventure.css
- textAdventure.js (~2600 lines)

### Data Files (HALLOWEEN-GAME/)
- gameData.json (meta, about, startup)

- rooms-w-doors.json (13 rooms, 13 doors)
- items.json (27 items)
- scavengerItems.json (11 scavenger items - 9 in use)
- uiConfig.json
- keyboardShortcuts.json

- Background images for scavenger grid
