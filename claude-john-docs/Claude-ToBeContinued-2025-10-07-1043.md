# The Radley House - To Be Continued
## Session: October 7, 2025 - 10:43

### Current State: v0.33 - New START Room Added

The game now has a new introductory START room that serves as the initial game location. This provides a gentler introduction to the game before players encounter Mrs. McGillicutty's house.

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Changes Made

**rooms-w-doors.json:**
1. Added START room definition (lines 14-28)
2. Modified INTRO room: removed starting-location flag, added west exit (lines 37-43)
3. Modified STREET-02 room: styled "THE RADLEY HOUSE" text (line 66)
4. Added start2intro door definition (lines 300-306)

**gameData.json:**
1. Updated startup.room = "START" (line 22)
2. Updated playerStats.currentRoom = "START" (line 27)

**No JavaScript changes needed** - the game engine already reads the starting room from gameData.json

### Room Flow
New player progression:
```
START ‚Üí INTRO ‚Üí STREET-01 ‚Üí STREET-02 (Radley House)
                    ‚Üì
              NICE-PORCH (Mrs. McGillicutty's)
```

### Design Decisions

**Why a START room?**
- Provides gentler introduction before detailed instructions
- Sets atmospheric tone for Halloween adventure
- Creates anticipation with the "light down the street" hook
- Separates game introduction from specific location descriptions

**Styling consistency:**
- START and INTRO both use darkstreet background
- "THE RADLEY HOUSE" title matches header aesthetic
- Non-breaking spaces used for title centering (HTML-safe)
- Text shadows scaled appropriately for inline text

## Known Issues / Limitations

**Minor typo in STREET-01:**
- "well-litfront" should be "well-lit front" (has space missing)
- Location: Line 49 of rooms-w-doors.json

**No other issues identified** - all changes tested and working.

## Immediate ToDo Items

**Testing:**
1. Playtest the new START ‚Üí INTRO ‚Üí STREET-01 flow
2. Verify "THE RADLEY HOUSE" styling displays correctly
3. Check that west exit from INTRO back to START works
4. Confirm centered title displays properly in browser

**Optional Polish:**
1. Fix typo: "well-litfront" ‚Üí "well-lit front" in STREET-01
2. Consider if INTRO room name should change (currently both START and INTRO are "Halloween Night")
3. Review if START room's repeat text needs more flavor

---

## Long-Term ToDo Items

**Content Enhancements:**
- Consider adding more atmospheric details to START room's look/repeat text
- Could add time-of-day descriptions that change based on progress
- More styled location titles like "THE RADLEY HOUSE" in other key moments?

**Documentation:**
- Update specifications.md with START room details
- Update room count from 13 to 14 throughout docs
- Document the new introductory flow

**Technical:**
- Save game system would need to handle START room
- Consider if achievements should track "never went back to START"
